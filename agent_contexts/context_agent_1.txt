# Differential equations

A differential equation is an equation involving a function and its derivative (or derivatives). Our goal is to find the function, if one exists, that satisfies the given differential equation. For example, y = sin(x) is a solution to the ordinary differential equation,

![](https://www.math.net/mj/eScodGFuKHgpKS15ID0gMA==_100.svg)

To show this, we can find the derivative of the solution, y'(x), and substitute it, as well as y(x), into the differential equation. Differentiating y = sin(x) yields y' = cos(x). Substituting these into the differential equation,

which satisfies the differential equation. Further, it can be shown that y = Csin(x) is a family of solutions called the general solution of the differential equation, where C is some arbitrary constant. The solution y = sin(x) is referred to as a particular solution to the differential equation.

There are various types of differential equations and a number of different methods that can be used to solve them. It is therefore important to be able to classify different differential equations.

## Classifying differential equations

On this page, we will define two types of differential equations: ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) contains a function with one independent variable along with its derivative(s). A partial differential equation (PDE) contains a function of several variables and their partial derivatives. Below are a few examples of each.

Differential equations can be further classified based on characteristics such as their order, degree, linearity, and whether or not they are homogeneous.

## Order and degree

The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation. Below are some examples of differential equations based on their order.

[YouTube course](https://jirka.org/jirka.org#youtubecourse)

A first course on differential equations, aimed at engineering
students. The prerequisite for the course is the basic calculus sequence.
This free online book (OER more formally)
should be usable as a stand-alone
textbook or as a companion to a course using another book such as
Edwards and Penney,
_Dif­fe­ren­tial Equa­tions and Boun­da­ry Va­lue Pro­blems:_
_Computing and Modeling_
or Boyce and DiPrima,
_El­e­men­tary Dif­fer­en­tial Equa­tions and Boun­da­ry Va­lue Pro­blems_
(section correspondence to these two is given).
I developed and used this book to teach Math
286/285 at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Illi­nois at Ur­ba­na-Cham­paign
(one is a
4-day-a-week, the other a 3-day-a-week semester-long course).
I also used it for
Math 20D at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Ca­li­for­nia, San Diego
(a 3-day-a-week quarter-long course)
and Math 2233 (semester-long introduction) and Math 4233 (an upper division
continuation of 2233) at
Okla­homa State Uni­ver­si­ty.
There is enough material to run
a two-semester sequence depending on lecturer speed.

The aim is to provide a low cost, redistributable, not overly long,
high-quality textbook that students will keep rather than selling back
after the semester is over.
Even if the students throw it out or sell it, they can always
look it up on the net again.
Or perhaps today's students mostly use online sources to begin with.
(Chan­ces are your students might be using this book even if you are
requiring another one.)
You are free to have a local bookstore or copy
store make and sell copies for your students.
See below about the license.

Another aim of the book is to allow modification and customization
for a specific purpose if necessary. If you do modify the book,
mark it prominently as such to avoid confusion. This aspect is important for
the longevity of the book as well.
The book can be updated, fixed, and modified even if I happen
to drop off the face of the earth.
You do not have to depend on any publisher
being interested as with traditional textbooks.

Finally, errata are fixed promptly.
No need to wait several years for a new edition.
Every once in a while I may make some major addition and a new major version
(edition), and then in between as errata are fixed I make minor version
updates (like a corrected printing) usually once or twice a year,
depending on the errata discovered. Exercise, chapter, and section numbers
are preserved as much as humanly possible.

## Section8.1An Introduction to Differential Equations

### Motivating Questions

- What are differential equations? How are they useful?

- What is the order of a differential equation? What is an autonomous differential equation?


In [Section 5.3](https://mathbooks.unl.edu/sec-5-3-diff.html), we learned that a _differential equation_ is an equation that provides a description of a function’s derivative, which means that it tells us the function’s rate of change. In this chapter we will learn several methods for solving differential equations. We start by revisiting what a differential equation is.

Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world. For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:

> _Your money will grow at a 3% annual interest rate with us._

This innocuous statement is really a differential equation. Let’s translate: \\(A(t)\\) will be amount of money you have in your account at time \\(t\\text{.}\\) The rate at which your money grows is the derivative \\(dA/dt\\text{,}\\) and we are told that this rate is \\(0.03 A\\text{.}\\) This leads to the differential equation

\\begin{equation\*}
\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.03 A\\text{.}
\\end{equation\*}

This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation \\(\\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1\\text{.}\\) In the earlier example, the rate of change depends only on the independent variable \\(t\\text{,}\\) and we may find \\(s(t)\\) by integrating the velocity \\(4t+1\\text{.}\\) In the banking example, however, the rate of change depends on the dependent variable \\(A\\text{,}\\) so we’ll need some new techniques in order to find \\(A(t)\\text{.}\\)

### Example8.1.

Express the following statements as differential equations. In each case, you will need to introduce notation to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to clearly state what your notation means.

1. The population of a town grows continuously at an annual rate of 1.25%.

2. A radioactive sample loses 5.6% of its mass every day.

3. You have a bank account that continuously earns 4% interest every year. At the same time, you withdraw money continually from the account at the rate of $1000 per year.

4. A cup of hot chocolate is sitting in a 70\\(^\\circ\\) room. The temperature of the hot chocolate cools continuously by 10% of the difference between the hot chocolate’s tempe... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 5: myPhysicsLab Classifying Differential Equations

**Content:**
When you study differential equations, it is kind of like botany. You learn to look at
an equation and classify it into a certain group. The reason is that the techniques for
solving differential equations are common to these various classification groups. And
sometimes you can transform an equation of one type into an equivalent equation of
another type, so that you can use easier solution techniques. Here then are some of the
major classifications of differential equations:

On this page we assume that _x_and _y_are functions of time, _t_:

_x_ = _x_(t)

_y_ = _y_(t)

And the derivatives are with respect to _t_

## Partial vs. Ordinary

An ordinary differential equation (or ODE) has a discrete (finite) set of variables.
For example in the [simple pendulum](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/pendulum-en.html), there are two
variables: angle and angular velocity.

A partial differential equation (or PDE) has an infinite set of variables which
correspond to all the positions on a line or a surface or a region of space. For
example in the string simulation we have a continuous set of variables along the string
corresponding to the displacement of the string at each position. In practice we
approximate the infinite set of variables with a finite set of variables spread across
the string (or surface or volume) at each position.

For an ODE, each variable has a distinct differential equation using "ordinary"
derivatives. For a PDE, there is only one "partial" differential equation for each
dimension.

## First Order, Second Order

The _order_ of a differential equation is equal to the highest derivative in
the equation. The single-quote indicates differention. So _x_'
is a first
derivative, while _x_''
is a second derivative.

_x_' = 1/ _x_  is first-order

_x_'' = − _x_  is second-order

_x_'' \+ 2 _x_' \+ _x_ = 0   is second-order

## Linear vs. Non-linear

Linear just means that the variable in an equation appears only with a power of one.
So _x_is linear but _x_ 2is non-linear. Also any function like
cos( _x_)
is non-linear.

In math and physics, _linear_ generally means "simple" and
_non-linear_ means "complicated". The theory for solving linear equations is
very well developed because linear equations are simple enough to be solveable.
Non-linear equations can usually not be solved exactly and are the subject of much
on-going research. Here is a brief description of how to recognize a linear
equation.

Recall that the equation for a line is

_y_ = _m_ _x_ \+ _b_

where _m_, _b_are constants ( _m_is the slope, and _b_is the
_y_-intercept). In a differential equation, when the variables and their
derivatives are only multiplied by constants, then the equation is linear. The
variables and their derivatives must always appear as a simple first power. Here are
some examples.

_x_'' \+ _x_ = 0   is linear

_x_'' \+ 2x' + _x_ = 0   is linear

_x_' \+ 1/ _x_ = 0   is non-linear because 1/ _x_ is not a first power

_x_' \+ _x_ 2 = 0   is non-linear be... [Content truncated for context window]

# Differential Equations for Exponential Growth and Decay - Expii
We revisit exponential growth and decay from the perspective of differential equations: namely, the exponential differential equation, \\(y' = ky\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant (sometimes called the relative growth constant). The general solution is \\(y(t) = ce^{kt}\\), which exhibits exponential growth when \\(k\\) is positive, exponential decay when \\(k\\) is negative, and neither whether \\(k=0\\). Here \\(c = y(0)\\) is determined by the initial conditions (or sometimes other data).

### Source 9: Second Order Differential Equations

**Content:**
Here we learn how to solve equations of this type:

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ p_dy_ **dx** \+ qy = 0

## Differential Equation

A Differential Equation is an equation with a [function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html) and one or more of its [derivatives](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html):

Example: an equation with the function **y** and its derivative **_dy_ **dx****

## Order

The Order is the **highest derivative** (is it a first derivative? a [second derivative](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/second-derivative.html)? etc):

### Example:

_dy_ **dx** \+ y2 = 5x

It has only the first derivative _dy_ **dx**, so is "First Order"

### Example:

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ xy = sin(x)

This has a second derivative _d2y_ **dx2**, so is "Second Order" or "Order 2"

### Example:

_d3y_ **dx3** \+ x_dy_ **dx** \+ y = ex

This has a third derivative _d3y_ **dx3**which outranks the _dy_ **dx**, so is "Third Order" or "Order 3"

Before tackling second order differential equations, make sure you are familiar with the various methods for [solving first order differential equations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/differential-equations-solution-guide.html).

## Second Order Differential Equations

We can solve a second order differential equation of the type:

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ P(x)_dy_ **dx** \+ Q(x)y = f(x)

where P(x), Q(x) and f(x) are functions of x, by using:

[Undetermined Coefficients](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/differential-equations-undetermined-coefficients.html) which only works when f(x) is a polynomial, exponential, sine, cosine or a linear combination of those, or

[Variation of Parameters](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/differential-equations-variation-parameters.html) which is a little messier but works on a wider range of functions.

But here we begin by learning the case where **f(x) = 0** (this makes it "homogeneous"):

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ P(x)_dy_ **dx** \+ Q(x)y = 0

and also where the functions P(X) and Q(x) are constants **p** and **q**:

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ p_dy_ **dx** \+ qy = 0

Let's learn to solve them!

### **_e_** to the rescue

We are going to use a special property of the [derivative](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-rules.html) of the [exponential function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function-exponential.html):

At any point the slope (derivative) of _**e**_ x equals the value of _**e**_ x :

And when we introduce a value "r" like this:

f(x) = erx

We find:

- the first derivative is f'(x) = rerx
- the second derivative is f''(x) = r2erx

In other words, the first and second derivatives of f(x) are both **multiples** of f(x)

This is going to help us a lot!

### Example 1: Solve

_d2y_ **dx2** \+ _dy_ **dx** − 6y = 0

Let y = erx so we get:

- _dy_ **dx** = rerx
- _d2y_ **dx2** = r2erx

Substitute these into the equation above:

r2erx \+ rerx − 6erx = 0

Simplify:

erx(r2 \+ r − 6) = 0

r2 \+ r − 6 = 0

We have reduced the differential equation to an ordinary ... [Content truncated for context window]
