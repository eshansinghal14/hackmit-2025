# Introduction to calculus

**Differential equations** are an important concept in calculus as they can be used to describe how things change over time or space. For example, differential equations can be used to model changes in the speed of an object, the changing size of a population, changes in the number of people infected with a disease, how temperature changes as heat spreads in an object, and more.

However, while they are very good at expressing these changes, differential equations on their own are generally difficult to use. For this reason it is good to have an understanding of how to solve them, and while this can be tricky, this page covers a technique to solve differential equations that are in a certain form. First, though, we look at what exactly differential equations are, and the different types.

## Differential equations

A **differential equation** is an equation that involves one or more [derivatives](https://uniskills.library.curtin.edu.au/numeracy/calculus/derivatives/). For example, the following are all differential equations:

\\\[\\begin{aligned}
\\frac{dy}{dx} &= 4x + 5 \\\\
\\frac{dP}{dt} &= rP(1-\\frac{P}{k}) \\\\
4x^2\\cos\\,y\\,\\frac{dy}{dx} &= 10 \\\\
7\\,\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\,\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2x &= \\frac{4}{t^2} \\\\
\\end{aligned}\\\]

In particular, these are all examples of what are called **ordinary differential equations**, as they each only contain derivatives taken with respect to one variable (that is, they only contain derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) or \\(t\\) but not both). If a differential equation contains derivatives with respect to more than one variable these are partial derivatives and the equation is a partial differential equation, but these are not covered here.

Differential equations also differ in terms of their order and degree. The **order** of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative contained in the equation. If it is a [first derivative](https://uniskills.library.curtin.edu.au/numeracy/calculus/derivatives/#understanding-derivatives) then it is referred to as a first order differential equation, if it is a second derivative it is a second order differential equation, and so on. For example, the first three differential equations above are first order differential equations, while the fourth one is a second order differential equation.

The **degree** of a differential equation is the [exponent](https://uniskills.library.curtin.edu.au/numeracy/algebra/exponents-logarithms/#what-are-exponents) of the highest derivative in the equation. For example, the following differential equation is a second degree differential equation (actually it is a first order second degree ordinary differential equation):

\\\[(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + 2y = 3x^3\\\]

The differential equation below, on the other hand, is only a first degree differential equation as its highest derivative does not have an exponent (in fact it is a second order first d... [Content truncated for context window]

In previous chapters, we have seen that a function‚Äôs derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function‚Äôs rate of change. For instance, an object‚Äôs velocity tells us the rate of change of that object‚Äôs position. By integrating the velocity over a time interval, we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval. If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval, we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.

In this chapter, we introduce the concept of _differential equations_. A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function‚Äôs derivative, which means that it tells us the function‚Äôs rate of change. Using this information, we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself. Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function. Unfortunately, this is too much to ask in some situations, but you are still be able to make accurate approximations. However, for this chapter we will stick to cases in which we can find an explicit solution to a differential equation.

Learning Objectives

- Identify the order of a differential equation.
- Explain what is meant by a solution to a differential equation.
- Distinguish between the general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation.
- Identify an initial-value problem.
- Identify whether a given function is a solution to a differential equation or an initial-value problem.

Calculus is the mathematics of change, and rates of change are expressed by derivatives. Thus, one of the most common ways to use calculus is to set up an equation containing an unknown function \\(y=f(x)\\) and its derivative, known as a differential equation. Solving such equations often provides information about how quantities change and frequently provides insight into how and why the changes occur.

Techniques for solving differential equations can take many different forms, including direct solution, use of graphs, or computer calculations. We introduce the main ideas in this chapter and describe them in a little more detail later in the course. In this section we study what differential equations are, how to verify their solutions, some methods that are used for solving them, and some examples of common and useful equations.

## General Differential Equations

Consider the equation \\(y‚Ä≤=3x^2,\\) which is an example of a differential equation because it includes a derivative. There is a relationship between the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y:y\\) is an unknown function of \\(x\\). Furthermore, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of \\(y\\). Therefore we can interpret this equation as follows: Start with some function \\(y=f(x)\\) and take its derivative. The answer must be equal to \\(3x^2\\). What function has a derivative that is equal to \\(3x^2\\)? One such function is \\(y=x^3\\), so this function is considered a _solution_ to a differential equation.

Definition: differential equation

A _differential equation_ is an equation involving an unknown function \\(y=f(x)\\) and one or more of its derivatives. A solution to a differential equation is a function \\(y=f(x)\\) that satisfies the differential equation when \\(f\\) and its derivatives are substituted into the equation.

Some examples of differential equations and their solutions appear in Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\).

| **Equation** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| \\(y'=2x\\) | \\(y=x^2\\) |
| \\(y'+3y=6x+11\\) | \\(y=e^{‚àí3x}+2x+3\\) |

### Section 2.8 : Equilibrium Solutions

In the previous section we modeled a population based on the assumption that the growth rate would be a constant. However, in reality this doesn‚Äôt make much sense. Clearly a population cannot be allowed to grow forever at the same rate. The growth rate of a population needs to depend on the population itself. Once a population reaches a certain point the growth rate will start reduce, often drastically. A much more realistic model of a population growth is given by the **logistic growth equation**. Here is the logistic growth equation.

\\\[P' = r\\left( {1 - \\frac{P}{K}} \\right)P\\\]

In the logistic growth equation \\(r\\) is the **intrinsic growth rate** and is the same \\(r\\) as in the last section. In other words, it is the growth rate that will occur in the absence of any limiting factors. \\(K\\) is called either the **saturation level** or the **carrying capacity**.

Now, we claimed that this was a more realistic model for a population. Let‚Äôs see if that in fact is correct. To allow us to sketch a direction field let‚Äôs pick a couple of numbers for \\(r\\) and \\(K\\). We‚Äôll use \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(K = 10\\). For these values the logistics equation is.

\\\[P' = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( {1 - \\frac{P}{{10}}} \\right)P\\\]

If you need a refresher on sketching direction fields go back and take a look at that [section](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/de/DirectionFields.aspx). First notice that the derivative will be zero at \\(P = 0\\) and \\(P = 10\\). Also notice that these are in fact solutions to the differential equation. These two values are called **equilibrium solutions** since they are constant solutions to the differential equation. We‚Äôll leave the rest of the details on sketching the direction field to you. Here is the direction field as well as a couple of solutions sketched in as well.

Note, that we included a small portion of negative \\(P\\)‚Äôs in here even though they really don‚Äôt make any sense for a population problem. The reason for this will be apparent down the road. Also, notice that a population of say 8 doesn‚Äôt make all that much sense so let‚Äôs assume that population is in thousands or millions so that 8 actually represents 8,000 or 8,000,000 individuals in a population.

Notice that if we start with a population of zero, there is no growth and the population stays at zero. So, the logistic equation will correctly figure out that. Next, notice that if we start with a population in the range \\... [Content truncated for context window]

## Section4.1Introduction to Differential Equations and Antiderivatives

### Motivating Questions

- What is a differential equation and how do these models relate to discrete-time dynamical systems?

- What is a solution to a differential equation and how does this relate to the concept of an antiderivative?


In [Section¬†1.7](https://www.math.colostate.edu/~shriner/sec-1-7.html) we were introduced to _discrete-time dynamical systems_, which describe systems of data taken at equally spaced intervals. These systems have an _updating function_ (which can be written as a _difference equation_) that describes how the system‚Äôs average rate of change between discrete points behaves over time. If we have an _initial value_ for the system, we can describe an associated _solution function_, which is an explicit description of how the system behaves over time.

For a discrete-time dynamical system, describing the _average_ rate of change of the system makes sense since we have discrete points. However, if we are modeling _continuous-time dynamical systems_, we have enough data to describe the system‚Äôs _instantaneous_ rate of change. Such models are called _differential equations_. Similar to discrete-time dynamical systems, given an initial value an important question is to describe the associated solution function.

### Warm-Up4.1.1.

Let \\(s(t)\\) be a function such that \\(s'(t) = 4t + 1\\text{.}\\)

1. What are the critical number(s) of \\(s(t)\\text{?}\\) How do you know?

2. When is \\(s\\) increasing? decreasing? How do you know?

3. Sketch at least two possible graphs of \\(s(t)\\) using your answers from above. How are they related?


### Subsection4.1.1Differential Equations

A differential equation is an equation that describes derivative values of a function that is unknown to us. For example, the equation \\(s'(t) = 4t + 1\\) from Warm-Up¬†4.1.1 is a differential equation which describes a function \\(s(t)\\text{.}\\) Note that \\(\\dfrac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1\\) is the same differential equation which uses a different notation for the first derivative. Differential equations are a very broad class of equations, and there are courses devoted to just this topic. As such, this text will only explore the basics of analyzing specific types of differential equations.

and their solutions.

In studying integration, you _already_ have considered solutions to very simple differential equations. For example, when you look to solving
