**Content:**
# Differential Equations
## Definition
A differential equation is an equation containing derivatives of a
dependent variable \\(y\\) with respect
to independent variables \\(x\\). In
particular,
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are differential equations
having one independent variable.
- Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are differential equations
having two or more independent variables.
## Order
An ODE is said to be of order \\(n\\)
if the highest derivative of the unknown function in the equation is the
\\(n\\)th derivative with respect to the
independent variable.
## Linearity
\\\[a\_n(x)y^{(n)} + a\_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \\ldots +
a\_1(x)y' + a\_0(x)y = b(x),\\\]
\\(x\\)\\(y\\)\\(n\\)\\(y^{(n)}\\)\\(x\\)\\(b(x)\\)\\(a\_i(x)\\) and all of its derivatives appear by
themselves. Thus, it is of the form: An ODE is said to be linear only if the function
# First Order Differential Equations
1. \\\[\\int
A(x)dx + \\int B(y)dy = C;\\\]
, it is separable, and
the solution follows by integration: If the equation can be put in the form
2. If \\(M(x,y)\\) and \\(N(x,y)\\) are homogeneous and of the same
degree in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then substitution of \\(vx\\) for \\(y\\) (thus, \\(dy =
v dx + x dv\\)) will yield a separable equation in the variables
\\(x\\) and \\(y\\). (A function such as \\(M(x,y)\\) is homogeneous of degree \\(n\\) in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) if \\(M(cx,cy)
= c^n M(x,y)\\)).
3. If \\(M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy\\) is
the differential of some function \\(F(x,y)\\), then the given equation is said
to be exact. A necessary and sufficient condition for exactness is \\(\\frac{dM}{dy} - \\frac{dN}{dx}\\). When the
equation is exact, \\(F\\) is found from
the relations \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}
= M\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial
y} = N\\), and the solution is \\(F(x,y)
= C\\) (a constant).
4. \\\[\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x).\\\]
yields . Multiplication by : Such
an equation has the form Linear, order one in
# Second Order Linear Equations (with Constant Coefficients)
1. **Right-hand side: 0 (homogeneous case)**
The second-order linear homogeneous equation is given by:
\\\[(b\_2D^2 + b\_1D + b\_0)y = 0.\\\]
The auxiliary equation associated with this equation is:
\\\[b\_2m^2 + b\_1m + b\_0 = 0.\\\]
If the roots of the auxiliary equation are real and distinct, denoted
as \\(m\_1\\) and \\(m\_2\\), the solution is:
\\\[y = C\_1e^{m\_1x} +
C\_2e^{m\_2x},\\\]
where \\(C\_1\\) and \\(C\_2\\) are arbitrary constants.
If the roots of the auxiliary equation are real and repeated, say
\\(m\_1 = m\_2 = p\\), the solution is:
\\\[y = C\_1e^{px} + C\_2xe^{px}.\\\]
If the roots of the auxiliary equation are complex, \\(a + ib\\) and \\(a
\- ib\\), the solution is:
\\\[y = C\_1e^{ax}\\cos(bx) +
C\_2e^{ax}\\sin(bx).\\\]
2. **Right-hand side: \\(f(x)\\) (nonhomogeneous case)**
The second-order linear nonhomogeneous equation is given by:
\\\[(b\_2D^2 + b\_1D + b\_0)y =
f(x).\\\]
The general solution is:
\\\[y = C\_1y\_1(x) + C\_2y\_2(x) +... [Content truncated for context window]

**Content:**
##### Learning Objectives

- Identify the order of a differential equation.
- Explain what is meant by a solution to a differential equation.
- Distinguish between the general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation.
- Identify an initial-value problem.
- Identify whether a given function is a solution to a differential equation or an initial-value problem.

Calculus is the mathematics of change, and rates of change are expressed by derivatives. Thus, one of the most common ways to use calculus is to set up an equation containing an unknown function \\(y=f(x)\\) and its derivative, known as a differential equation. Solving such equations often provides information about how quantities change and frequently provides insight into how and why the changes occur.

Techniques for solving differential equations can take many different forms, including direct solution, use of graphs, or computer calculations. We introduce the main ideas in this chapter and describe them in a little more detail later in the course. In this section we study what differential equations are, how to verify their solutions, some methods that are used for solving them, and some examples of common and useful equations.

## General Differential Equations

Consider the equation \\(y′=3x^2,\\) which is an example of a differential equation because it includes a derivative. There is a relationship between the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y:y\\) is an unknown function of \\(x\\). Furthermore, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of \\(y\\). Therefore we can interpret this equation as follows: Start with some function \\(y=f(x)\\) and take its derivative. The answer must be equal to \\(3x^2\\). What function has a derivative that is equal to \\(3x^2\\)? One such function is \\(y=x^3\\), so this function is considered a _solution_ to a differential equation.

##### Definition: differential equation

A _differential equation_ is an equation involving an unknown function \\(y=f(x)\\) and one or more of its derivatives. A solution to a differential equation is a function \\(y=f(x)\\) that satisfies the differential equation when \\(f\\) and its derivatives are substituted into the equation.

Go to this website to explore more on this topic.

Some examples of differential equations and their solutions appear in Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\).

| **Equation** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| \\(y'=2x\\) | \\(y=x^2\\) |
| \\(y'+3y=6x+11\\) | \\(y=e^{−3x}+2x+3\\) |
| \\(y''−3y'+2y=24e^{−2x}\\) | \\(y=3e^x−4e^{2x}+2e^{−2x}\\) |

Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Examples of Differential Equations and Their Solutions

Note that a solution to a differential equation is not necessarily unique, primarily because the derivative of a constant is zero. For example, \\(y=x^2+4\\) is also a solution to the first differential equation in Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\). We will return to this idea a little bit later in this section. For now, let’s focus on what it means for a function... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 38: A Single Differential Equation

**Content:**
Algebraic operations such as addition and multiplication are performed on numbers
while the calculus operations of differentiation and integration are performed on
functions. Thus algebraic equations (such as ) are solved for numbers () while
differential (and integral) equations are solved for functions.

In Chapter ?? we discussed how to solve systems of linear equations, such as

for numbers while in this chapter we discuss how to solve some systems of
differential equations for functions.

Solving a single linear equation in one unknown is a simple task. For example, solve
for . Solving a single differential equation in one unknown function is far from
trivial.

##### Integral Calculus as a Differential Equation

Mathematically, the simplest type of differential equation is:

where is some continuous function. In words, this equation asks us to find all
functions whose derivative is . The fundamental theorem of calculus tells
us the answer: is an antiderivative of . Thus to find all solutions, we just
integrate both sides of (??) with respect to . Formally, using indefinite integrals,
where is an arbitrary constant. (It is tempting to put a constant of integration on
both sides of (??), but two constants are not needed, as we can just combine both
constants on the right hand side of this equation.) Since the indefinite integral of is
just the function , we have
In particular, finding closed form solutions to differential equations of the type (??) is
equivalent to finding all definite integrals of the function . Indeed, to find closed form
solutions to differential equations like (??) we need to know all of the techniques of
integration from integral calculus.

##### Initial Conditions and the Role of the Integration Constant

Equation (??) tells us that there are an infinite number of solutions to the differential
equation (??), each one corresponding to a different choice of the constant . To
understand how to interpret the constant , consider the example Using (??) we see
that the answer is Note that Thus, the constant represents an initial condition for
the differential equation. We will return to the discussion of initial conditions several
times in this chapter.

See Exercise ?? for a more interesting example of this type of differential
equation.

##### Solutions to Differential Equations are Functions

Consider the differential equation

Are the functions solutions to the differential equation (??)?

To test whether or not the function is a solution, we compute the left and right hand
sides of (??):

Since the left and right hand sides are unequal, the function is not a solution to
(??).

To test whether or not the function is a solution, we again compute the left and right
hand sides of (??):

Since the left and right hand sides are equal, the function is a solution to
(??).

Note that we have not discussed how we knew that the function is a solution to (??).
For the most part, the issue of how one finds solutions to a differential e... [Content truncated for context window]

### Key points

- A differential equation is an equation involving a derivative.
- The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative.
- Differential equations are used to model situations which involve rates of change.
- The solution to a differential equation gives a relationship between the variables themselves, not the derivatives.
- The general solution of a first order differential equation satisfies the differential equations and has a constant of integration in its solution.
- The particular solution of a differential equation is one in which additional information has been used to calculate the constant of integration.
- The general solution may be represented by a family of curves and the particular solution is one of that family.
- To verify that a function is a particular solution, you must check that it satisfies the differential equation and initial conditions.

How does the quantity of drug in the body vary with time? How long does it take a cup of coffee take to cool? After how many days will the moon take the same shape again? These question all have on thing in common. They have a quantity that is continuously changing. We see change in most things in life. Some changes are permanent; like the temperature of coffee. Some have repeating patterns, like the cycle of the moon.

You have already studied a lot of mathematics to describe these changes, but never really put that into real life applications. You will know from previously studies calculus that the rate of change of a quantity is called a derivative... [Content truncated for context window]
