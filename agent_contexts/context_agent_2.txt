By the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of differential equations and be equipped with the tools to solve them with confidence. But before we delve into the specifics of solving differential equations, let's first understand what they are and why they are important. Differential equations are mathematical equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives.

They are used to describe how a system changes over time, making them an essential tool in modeling various physical, biological, and social phenomena. From predicting the spread of diseases to analyzing the stock market, differential equations play a crucial role in understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems. This makes them an invaluable tool for scientists and researchers in various fields. Now that we understand the significance of differential equations, let's explore the various techniques for solving them. From separation of variables to Laplace transforms, we will cover it all in this comprehensive guide. So get ready to expand your knowledge and master the art of solving differential equations. Let's dive in!Differential equations are an essential part of mathematics, used to model various real-world phenomena and analyze their behavior.

They differ from regular equations in that they involve derivatives and can express the rate of change of a function over time. This makes them incredibly useful in fields like physics, economics, and engineering where understanding how things change over time is crucial. There are two main types of differential equations: ordinary and partial. Ordinary differential equations involve a single independent variable, while partial differential equations involve multiple variables. They can also be classified based on their order, which refers to the highest derivative present in the equation. Now, let's dive into the different methods used for solving differential equations.

One approach is separation of variables, which involves isolating the dependent and independent variables on opposite sides of the equation and integrating both sides. Another method is using integrating factors, which is useful for solving linear differential equations. Additionally, Laplace transforms can be used to transform a differential equation into an algebraic equation, making it easier to solve.... [Content truncated for context window]

## Section1.1Modeling with Differential Equations

### Objectives

- To understand that a differential equation is an equation relating a function to one or more of its derivatives and that an initial value problem is a differential equation



\\begin{equation\*}
\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t,x),
\\end{equation\*}



where the initial condition, \\(x(t\_0) = x\_0\\text{,}\\) is specified.

- To understand and be able to apply the three principle steps in modeling any phenomenon with differential equations.



- Discovering the differential equation or equations that best describe a specified physical situation.

- Finding—either exactly or approximately—the appropriate solution of the equation or equations.

- Interpreting the solution in terms of the phenomenon.


- To understand and be able to apply the differential equations that model exponential growth and logistic growth.

- To understand that some phenomenon are best modeled by higher order differential equations or systems of differential equations.


Calculus tells us that the derivative of a function measures how the function changes. An equation relating a function to one or more of its derivatives is called a differential equation. The subject of differential equations is one of the most interesting and useful areas of mathematics. We can describe many interesting natural phenomena that involve change using differential equations. In addition, the theory of the subject has broad and important implications.

### Subsection1.1.1Exponential Growth

We begin our study of ordinary differential equations by modeling some real world phenomena. For a particular situation that we might wish to investigate, our first task is to write an equation (or equations) that best describes the phenomenon. Suppose that we wish to study how a population \\(P(t)\\) grows with time \\(t\\text{.}\\) We might make the assumption that a constant fraction of population is having offspring at any particular time. If we also assume that the population has a constant death rate, the change in the population \\(\\Delta P\\) during a small time interval \\(\\Delta t\\) will be

\\begin{equation\*}
\\Delta P \\approx k\_{\\text{birth}} P(t) \\Delta t - k\_{\\text{death}} P(t) \\Delta t,
\\end{equation\*}

where \\(k\_{\\text{birth}}\\) is the fraction of the population having ... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 14: Differential Equations for A Level

**Content:**
### Differential Equations
An equation in the form of dy/dx = f(x) g(y) is called a differential equation of the _first order,_ where f(x) and g(y) are functions of x and y respectively
**E.g.**
dy/dx = xy is a differential equation where x and y are functions of x and y respectively.
In order to integrate a differential equation, the variables must be separated as follows:
dy/dx = f(x) g(y)
dy/g(y) = f(x) dx
**E.g.1**
dy/dx = xy
∫ dy/y = ∫ x dx
ln y = x2/2 + c
y = ex2 \+ c
**E.g.2**
dy/dx = cos2y ex
dy/cos2y = ex dx
∫ dy/cos2y = ∫ ex dx
∫ dy sec2y = ∫ ex dx
tan y = ex \+ c
#### Exponential Growth / Decay
If a rate of change is proportional to its quantity, such a rate is called **Exponential Growth / Decay.**
**E.g.1**
The rate of increase in population of a colony of bacteria is proportional to the number of bacteria in the colony at a given time. Therefore, such a rate of increase is an exponential growth.
So, dN/dt ∝ N
dN/dt = k N
dN/N = k dt
∫ dN/N = ∫ k dt
ln N = kt + c
N = ekt \+ c
N = ekt X ec \-\-\-\- **1**
Let N = N0 when t = 0
N0 = ec
Sub this in **1**
N = N0ekt
This is exponential growth. The following image indicates the graphical nature of the growth.
![Exponential growth](https://www.vivaxsolutions.com/images/expo_growth.gif)
**E.g.2**
The rate of decay of radioactive nuclei in a radioactive substance is directly proportional to the number of remaining nuclei at a given time. Therefore, this is an exponential decay.
So, dN/dt ∝ -N ---- the negative sign indicates a decay or a loss
dN/dt = -k N
dN/N = -k dt
∫ dN/N = ∫ k dt
ln N = -kt + c
N = e-kt \+ c
N = e-kt X ec \-\-\-\- **1**
Let N = N0 when t = 0
N0 = ec
Sub this in **1**
N = N0e-kt
This is exponential decay. The following image indicates the graphical nature of the decay against time.

### Source 15: 3.9: Differential Equations

**Content:**
[Skip to main content](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Applied_Calculus_(Calaway_Hoffman_and_Lippman)/03%3A_The_Integral/3.09%3A_Differential_Equations#elm-main-content)

A **differential equation** is an equation involving the derivative of a function. They allow us to express with a simple equation the relationship between a quantity and it's rate of change.

##### Example \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)

A bank pays 2% interest on its certificate of deposit accounts, but charges a $20 annual fee. Write an equation for the rate of change of the balance, \\( B'(t) \\).

**Solution**

If the balance \\( B(t) \\) has units of dollars, then \\( B'(t) \\) has units of dollars per year. When we think of what is changing the balance of the account, there are two factors:

1. The interest, which increases the balance, and
2. The fee, which decreases the balance.

Considering the interest, we know each year the balance will increase by 2%, but 2% of what? Each year that will change, since we earn interest on whatever the current balance is. We can represent the amount of increase as 2% of the balance: \\( 0.02B(t) \\) dollars/year.

The fee already has the units of dollars/year. Since everything now has the same units, we can put the two together, and create the equation: \\\[ B'(t)=0.02B(t)-20. \\nonumber \\\]

The result is an example of a differential equation. Notice this particular equation involves both the derivative _and_ the original function, and so we can't simply find \\( B(t) \\) using basic integration.

Algebraic equations contain constants and variables, and the solutions of an algebraic equation are typically numbers. For example, \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = -2\\) are solutions of the algebraic equation \\(x^2 = x + 6\\). Differential equations contain derivatives or differentials of functions. Solutions of differential equations are functions. The differential equation \\(y' = 3x^2\\) has infinitely many solutions, and two of those solutions are the functions \\(y = x^3 + 2\\) and \\(y = x^3 - 4\\).

![graphs](https://math.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/66136/clipboard_e64a0ae1da7d30b0e187c992a1030019c.png?revision=1)

You have already solved lots of differential equations: every time you found an antiderivative of a function \\(f(x)\\), you solved the differential equation \\(y' = f(x)\\) to get a solution \\(y\\). The differential equation \\(y' = f(x)\\), however, is just the beginning. Other applications generate different differential equations, like in the bank balance example above.

## Checking Solutions of Differential Equations

Whether a differential equation is easy or difficult to solve, it is important to be able to check that a possible solution really satisfies the differential equation.

A possible solution of an algebraic equation can be checked by putting the solution into the equation to see if the result is true: \\(x = 3\\) is a solution of \\(5x + 1 = 16\\) since \\(5(3) + 1 = 16\\) is true. Similarly, a solutio... [Content truncated for context window]

# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

Differential
equations
are
important
because
for
many
physical
systems,
one
can,
subject
to
suitable
idealizations,
formulate
a
differential
equation
that
describes
how
the
system
changes
in
time.
Understanding
the

of
the

interest.

The
simplest
ODE
is:

You
can
verify
that
any
function

y(t)
=
Cekt

where
C
is
a
constant,
is
a
solution
to
this
ODE.
If
k
>
0,
this
ODE
thus
describes **exponential**
**growth** (for
example,
unrestricted
population
growth).
If
k
<
0,
the
interpretation
is **exponential**
**decay** (for
example,
the
decay
of
radioactive
atoms).

In
many
applications
you
will
encounter
the
ODE:

where
ω
is
a
constant.

You
can
verify
that
any
function

y(t)
=
A
sin(ωt
+
ø)
,

where
A
and
ø
are
constants,
is
a
solution.
This
ODE
thus
describes
a
physical
system
whose
behaviour
is **periodic**
**in**
**time**.
We
say
that
the
system
undergoes **simple**
**harmonic**
**motion** with
amplitude
A,
frequency
ω,
and
phase
ø.

In
the
foundational
courses
on
ODEs
you
will
learn
to
identify
whether
an

be
solved
explicitly
(most
cannot!),

## Solving Differential Equations

Differential equations are solved by finding the function for which the equation holds true.

### Learning Objectives

Calculate the order and degree of a differential equation.

### Key Takeaways

#### Key Points

- The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest-order derivative; the degree is determined by the highest power on a variable.
- The higher the order of the differential equation, the more arbitrary constants need to be added to the general solution. A first-order equation will have one, a second-order two, and so on.
- A particular solution can be found by assigning values to the arbitrary constants to match any given constraints.

#### Key Terms

- **function**: a relation in which each element of the domain is associated with exactly one element of the co-domain
- **derivative**: a measure of how a function changes as its input changes

A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several variables that relates the values of the function itself to its derivatives of various orders. Differential equations play a prominent role in engineering, physics, economics, and other disciplines.
Differential equations take a form similar to:
\[latex-display\]f(x) + f'(x) =0\[/latex-display\]
where \[latex\]f'\[/latex\] is "f-prime," the derivative of \[latex\]f\[/latex\]. As you can see, such an equation relates a function \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] to its derivative. Solving the differential equation means solving for the function \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\].
The "order" of a differential equation depends on the derivative of the highest order in the equation. The "degree" of a differential equation, similarly, is determined by the highest exponent on any variables involved. For example, the differential equation shown in is of second-order, third-degree, and the one above is of first-order, first-degree.

### Solving a Differential Equation: A Simple Example

Take the following differential equation:
\[latex-display\]\\displaystyle{f(x) + f'(x) =0}\[/latex-display\]
This equation states that \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] is equal to the negative of its derivative. You may recall that one function that satisfies this property is \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] = \[latex\]e^{-x}\[/latex\]. The derivative of
\[latex-display\]f(x)\[/latex-display\]
equals -\[latex\]e^{-x}\[/latex\] i.e.  -\[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\]   so this function solves the differential equation.
A complete solution contains the same number of arbitrary constants as the order of the original equation. (This is because, in order to solve a differential equation of the \[latex\]n\[/latex\]th order, you will integrate \[latex\]n\[/latex\] times, each time adding a new arbitrary constant.) Since our example above is a first-order equation, it will have just one arbitrary constant in the complete solution. Therefore, the general solution is \[latex\]f(x) = Ce^{-x}\[/latex\], where \[latex\]C\[/latex\] stands fo... [Content truncated for context window]
