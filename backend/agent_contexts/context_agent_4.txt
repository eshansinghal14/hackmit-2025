**Content:**
As there is no specific background or experience required for you to become a Python Developer, there are a number of ways you can enter the field. It all starts, however, with a specific set of skills, and more specifically, a mastery of the Python programming language.

Many Developers find that the Python programming language has a lot of features that give it an edge over other programming languages.

For instance, easy syntax and readability makes learning Python a lot easier, which should help you boost your skills with Python relatively quickly. And based on Stack Overflow question views in World Bank high-income countries, Python is only rising in popularity among programming languages.

**How to Become a Python Developer in Three Steps:**

1. [Learn to read and write in Python](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#learn-to-read-and-write-in-the-python-programming-language)
2. [Work on projects with Python to develop your skills](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#work-on-projects-with-python-to-develop-your-skills)
3. [Develop a portfolio of projects completed with Python](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#develop-a-portfolio-of-projects-completed-with-python)

## 1\. Learn to Read and Write in Python

Since Python is relatively easy and intuitive for newcomers to learn, a Python Programming course, [online tutorial](https://brainstation.io/learn/python), or [coding bootcamp](https://brainstation.io/) could help you quickly learn how to read and write in the language and leave you feeling like a Python pro in a very short period of time.

Because Python is a versatile, general-purpose, and extremely popular programming language, it’s often considered the **best first language for newcomers to learn**.

It’s an excellent choice as an introductory language because it is concise and easy to read, even for people with no experience with coding or computer science. And since it’s so widely useful — it can be used for everything from web development to software development or even scientific applications — it’s really a language any programmer should have in his or her stack.

Python is also one of the most widely used languages for Back-End Developers, Data Scientists, and Machine Learning Engineers.

_Because Python has so many applications, Python skills can be valuable to a number of other job roles, even if you have only basic knowledge of how it works._

And because it’s relatively straightforward, some courses promise they can make you a Python professional in as little time as 25 hours.

BrainStation, for example, offers a part-time online [Python Programming Course](https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming).

[Part 1](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1)

# Getting started

Computer programs consist of _commands_, each command instructing the computer to take some action. A computer executes these commands one by one. Among other things, commands can be used to perform calculations, compare things in the computer's memory, cause changes in how the program functions, relay messages or ask for information from the program's user.

Let's begin programming by getting familiar with the `print` command, which _prints_ text. In this context, printing essentially means that the program will show some text on the screen.

The following program will print the line "Hi there!":

```
print("Hi there!")
```

When the program is run, it produces this:

Sample output

Hi there!

The program will not work unless the code is written exactly as it is above. For example, trying to run the print command without the quotation marks, like so

```
print(Hi there!)
```

will not print out the message, but instead causes an error:

Sample output

```
File "", line 1
 print(Hi there!)
 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

In summary, if you want to print text, the text must all be encased in quotation marks or Python will not interpret it correctly.

## A program of multiple commands

Multiple commands written in succession will be executed in order from first to last.
For example this program

```
print("Welcome to Introduction to Programming!")
print("First we will practice using the print command.")
print("This program prints three lines of text on the screen.")
```

prints the following lines on the screen:

Sample output

Welcome to Introduction to Programming!
First we will practice using the print command.
This program prints three lines of text on the screen.

## Arithmetic operations

You can also put arithmetic operations inside a `print` command. Running it will then print out the result of the operation. For example, the following program

```
print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)
```

prints out these lines:

Sample output

7
9
22

Notice the lack of quotation marks around the arithmetic operations above. Quotation marks are used to signify _strings_. In the context of programming, strings are sequences of characters. They can consist of letters, numbers and any other types of characters, such as punctuation. Strings aren't just words as we commonly understand them, but instead a single string can be as long as multiple complete sentences.
Strings are usually printed out exactly as they are written. Thus, the following two commands produce two quite different results:

```
print(2 + 2 * 10)
print("2 + 2 * 10")
```

This program prints out:

Sample output

22
2 + 2 \* 10

With the second line of code, Python does not calculate the result of the operation, but instead prints ou... [Content truncated for context window]

## UNIT I: Introduction to Python:

- ### Python versus Java


Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug, but Python is easier to use and easier to read. (Ref: [https://www.bmc.com/blogs/python-vs-java/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fblogs%2Fpython-vs-java%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0RvZMjC-FNSLYfp0SBfc2P))

- ### Python Interpreter and it’s Environment


Translator (Converting High level language such as english to computer readable form because computer can understand binary(0 or1) language only)

a) Compiler : IT reads all program then convert whole code into machine level language. ( Example : C programming, C++, Core Java)

b) **Interpreter :**

Its reads line by line and convert line by line into machine level language. (Example : Python3) : it helps to run the program.

c) **Assembler**: (covert Assembly level language to machine level language )

- Python installation

## Learn Python Language Coding

See how to learn Python language coding tutorial code on the Python editor website online computer programming complete basics for beginners and advanced.

[← Previous](https://w3schools.work/php) [Next →](https://w3schools.work/w3schools.work)

Python is most of the time known as a helping language for programming designers, for developing control and the board, testing, and in numerous alternate ways.

Python coding for construct control of our functions and different programming purposes to get results.

### Python Language Base

Basic framework and Apache access for mechanized nonstop creation and testing. Startup or advanced for bug following and undertaking the executive’s problems and the solutions.

Python is a multi-purpose and deep-level programming language for advanced programming solutions.

Object-oriented programming in python and organized coding on computer programs are completely done in this, and large numbers of its functionalities are there.

It Supports practical programming and perspective arranged programming counting multiple functions and objects with the magic methods accessibility.

### How Python Works

There are different standards are frameworks of python language which deal with deep-level system access by means of expansions, including configuration by agreement and deep programming.

Python utilizes dynamic programming and a mix of reference coding projects.

And a cycle-recognizing bugs for the memory of the executive’s system.

It utilizes a dynamic function name goal error restricting. Which program ties strategy and variable names during code execution time.

Its plan offers some help for using programming in the program’s custom features. It has a filter, roadmap capabilities, and a list of appreciations, code references, function sets, and generator expressions.

The standard library of python has two modules iterations tools and functions that carry out using the instruments acquired from basic and standard programming.

### Python Language History

Python language’s central way of thinking is to grow up in the record and data manipulation with deep-level computer system access.

At the start, python was very limited in using language but now according to incorporating python language usage into every center of the programming project.

Python was intended to be more extensible by means of its features.

This minimal python set has made it especially famous for adding programmable connection that points to existing or new applications.

Python’s latest version of the release centers language with a huge standard library.

This effectively extensible coding originated from its framework with all features, which helps the language methodology and accessibility.
