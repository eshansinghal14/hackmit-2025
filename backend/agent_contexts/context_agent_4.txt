1 Basic Concepts and Notation
Linear algebra provides a way of compactly representing and operating on sets of linear
equations. For example, consider the following system of equations:
4x1 − 5x2 = −13
−2x1 + 3x2 = 9.
This is two equations and two variables, so as you know from high school algebra, you
can find a unique solution for x1 and x2 (unless the equations are somehow degenerate, for
example if the second equation is simply a multiple of the first, but in the case above there
is in fact a unique solution). In matrix notation, we can write the system more compactly
as
Ax = b
with
A =

4 −5
−2 3 
, b =

−13
9

.
As we will see shortly, there are many advantages (including the obvious space savings)
to analyzing linear equations in this for... [Content truncated for context window]

# **Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics**

## **Free online text by Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling**

**Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics**
is an introductory textbook designed for undergraduate mathematics majors
with an emphasis on abstraction and in particular the concept of
proofs in the setting of linear algebra. Typically such a student
will have taken calculus, though the only prerequisite is suitable
mathematical maturity. The purpose of this book is to bridge the gap
between the more conceptual and computational oriented lower division
undergraduate classes to the more abstract oriented upper division
classes. The book begins with systems of linear equations and complex
numbers, then relates these to the abstract notion of linear maps on
finite-dimensional vector spaces, and covers diagonalization,
eigenspaces, determinants, and the Spectral Theorem. Each chapter
concludes with both proof-writing and computational exercises.

**Content:**
1\. What is linear algebra
2\. Introduction to complex numbers
3\. The fundamental theorem of algebra and factoring polynomials
4\. Vector spaces
5\. Span and bases
6\. Linear maps
7\. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
8\. Permutations and the determinant
9\. Inner product spaces
10\. Change of bases
11\. The spectral theorem for normal linear maps
12\. Supplementary notes on matrices and linear systems
Appendix: The language of sets and functions; algebraic structures encountered; common math symbols; notation used

### Source 35: How to Self Study Linear Algebra for Students

**Content:**
**Estimated Read Time:** 5 minute(s)

**Common Topics:** algebra, linear, amazon, book, books

In this insight, I will give a roadmap to learn the basics of linear algebra for students. Aside from calculus, linear algebra is one of the most applicable subjects of all of mathematics. It is used a lot in engineering, sciences, computer sciences, etc. The right way to see linear algebra is with a focus on vector spaces and linear transformations. So I will suggest books with this perspective in mind.

Table of Contents

Toggle

## **Prerequisites**

There are essentially two prerequisites for studying linear algebra, besides the usual high school courses which include algebra, geometry and trigonometry (no, calculus is not a formal prerequisite). Those are that you must be used to proofs, and that you must have seen the basics of matrices and determinants.

For proofs, I recommend the following books in no particular order:
Velleman “How to prove it: a structured approach” [http://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995?tag=pfamazon01-20)
Bloch’s “Proofs and fundamentals: a first course in abstract mathematics” http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Fundamentals-Abstract-Mathematics-Undergraduate/dp/1441971262
Hammack’s “Book of proof” [http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)

These books will teach you the fundamentals of [proof based mathematics](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/proofs-in-mathematics/), and they will teach you the basic notations and assumptions of set theory. Both will be very necessary for algebra.

As for matrices and determinants, these should be covered in basic high school books. For example
Lang’s “Basic Mathematics” [http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877?tag=pfamazon01-20)
Openstaxcollege’s Algebra [https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-algebra](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-algebra)
Khan Academy’s Linear algebra [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix\_transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix_transformations)

Don’t worry, you don’t need to know matrices and determinants in full detail. Just knowing them for the 2×2 and 3×3 cases is already enough. In the linear algebra books which I’m going to mention, matrices and determinants will be treated in their full gory details. Also, don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of intuition for matrices and determinants, this intuition will come with studying vector spaces. Right now you are merely expected to being able to compute stuff like inverses of matrices and solving systems of equations.

## 1.1 Introduction to MAT 67

This class may well be one of your first mathematics classes that bridges the gap between the mainly computation-oriented lower division classes and the abstract mathematics encountered in more advanced mathematics courses. The goal of this class is threefold:

1. You will learn **Linear Algebra**, which is one of the most widely used mathematical theories around. Linear Algebra finds applications in virtually every area of mathematics, including Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations, and Probability Theory. It is also widely applied in fields like physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, and engineering. You are even relying on methods from Linear Algebra every time you use an Internet search like Google, the Global Positioning System (GPS), or a cellphone.
2. You will acquire **computational skills** to solve linear systems of equations, perform operations on matrices, calculate eigenvalues, and find determinants of matrices.
3. In the setting of Linear Algebra, you will be introduced to **abstraction**. We will develop the theory of Linear Algebra together, and you will learn to write proofs.

The lectures will mainly develop the theory of Linear Algebra, and the discussion sessions will focus on the computational aspects. The lectures and the discussion sections go hand in hand, and it is important that you attend both. The exercises for each Chapter are divided into more computation-oriented exercises and exercises that focus on proof-writing. There are also some very short webwork homework sets to make sure you have some basic skills. You can already try the first one that introduces some logical concepts by clicking below: Webwork link.

## 1.2 What is Linear Algebra?

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics aimed at solving systems of linear equations with a ﬁnite number of unknowns. In particular, one would like to obtain answers to the following questions:

- **Characterization of solutions**: Are there solutions to a given system of linear equations? How many solutions are there?
- **Finding solutions:** How does the solution set look? What are the solutions?

Linear Algebra is a systematic theory regarding the solutions of systems of linear equations.

**Example 1.2.1.** Let us take the following system of two linear equations in the two unknowns \\(x\_1\\) and \\(x\_2\\) :

\\begin{equation\*} \\left. \\begin{array}{rl} 2x\_1 + x\_2 &= 0 \\\ x\_1 - x\_2 &= 1 \\end{array} \\right\\}. \\end{equation\*}

This system has a **unique solution** for \\(x\_1,x\_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), namely \\(x\_1=\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(x\_2=-\\frac{2}{3}\\). This solution can be found in several different ways. One approach is to ﬁrst solve for one of the unknowns in one of the equations and then to substitute the result into the other equation. Here, for example, we might solve to obtain

\\\[ x\_1 = 1 + x\_2 \\\]
