## What is Data Structure?

Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.

- **Interface** − Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.

- **Implementation** − Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

### Source 33: Data Structures: A Comprehensive Introduction

**Content:**
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. It's like a blueprint that dictates how data elements are arranged and connected. Different data structures excel at different tasks. Some, like arrays, are fantastic for storing large collections of similar data with quick random access. Others, like linked lists, shine when frequent insertions and deletions are needed.

The choice of data structure significantly impacts how efficiently algorithms can operate on the data. A well-matched data structure can dramatically speed up computations, while a poor choice can lead to sluggish performance.

Data structures offer several key benefits:

- **Efficiency:** They optimize data access and manipulation, leading to faster programs.
- **Organization:** They provide a structured way to store and manage complex data relationships.
- **Reusability:** Well-defined data structures can be reused across different programs, saving development time.
- **Clarity:** They improve code readability by making data organization explicit.

## What Exactly Are Data Structures?

At its core, a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Just as a library uses shelves, sections, and catalog systems to organize books, software uses data structures to organize and store data. The choice of a specific data structure often depends on the nature of the application and the kind of operations that need to be performed on the data.

## Why are data structures important?

Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.
Their significance stems from a multitude of advantages that empower robust and performant software development.

- **Optimized Performance:** Data structures are architected to facilitate the swift retrieval and modification of data elements. Consider a scenario where a grocery list is stored within an array. This structure allows for the instantaneous retrieval of any specific item, directly translating to faster program execution and enhanced responsiveness – critical factors for user satisfaction.

- **Effective Representation of Complexities:** Data structures extend beyond mere data storage. They offer a powerful framework for modeling intricate relationships that exist between data elements. For instance, a tree structure excels at representing hierarchical relationships – akin to an organizational chart where employee... [Content truncated for context window]

**Content:**
## HashMap

[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html)

HashMap 的两种遍历方式
第一种

Copy

```
Map map =newHashMap();Iterator iter =map.entrySet().iterator();while (iter.hasNext()) {Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) iter.next();Object key =entry.getKey();Object val =entry.getValue();　　}
```

效率高,以后一定要使用此种方式！

第二种

Copy

```
Map map =newHashMap();Iterator iter =map.keySet().iterator();while (iter.hasNext()) {Object key =iter.next();Object val =map.get(key);　　}
```

效率低,以后尽量少使用！

Map Traverse:

Copy

```
Map map = new HashMap();// Keysfor(String str : map.keySet()){ Integer value = map.get(str);}// Map.Entryfor (Map.Entry e : map.entrySet()) System.out.println(e.getKey() + ": " + e.getValue());
```

The Collection view methods allow a **Map** to be viewed as a Collection in these three ways:

- **keySet** — the Set of keys contained in the **Map**.

- **values** — The Collection of values contained in the **Map**. This Collection is not a Set, because multiple keys can map to the same value.

- **entrySet** — the Set of key-value pairs contained in the **Map**. The Map interface provides a small nested interface called **Map.Entry**, the type of the elements in this Set.


**Differences Between HashMap Vs HashSet In Java**

## Union Find (Disjoint Set)

**并查集**: 一种用来解决集合查询合并的数据结构 支持O(1) find / O(1) union

### 并查集可以干什么?

1. 判断在不在同一个集合中。



- find 操作


2. 关于集合合并



- union 操作


### 并查集的操作

1. 查询 Find (递归? 非递归?)


模板代码

Copy

```
HashMap father = new HashMap ();int find(int x) { int parent = x; while (parent ! = father.get(parent)) { parent = father.get(parent); } return parent;}
```

1. 合并 Union


老大哥之间合并
跟小弟没关系

Copy

```
HashMap father = new HashMap ();void union(int x, int y) { int fa_x = find(x); int fa_y = find(y); if (fa_x != fa_y) { father.put(fa_x, fa_y); }}
```

### 并查集完整模板

Copy

```
class UnionFind { UnionFind() {} HashMap father = new HashMap (); int find(int x) { int parent = x; while (parent ! = father.get(parent)) { parent = father.get(parent); } return parent; } void union(int x, int y) { int fa_x = find(x); int fa_y = find(y); if (fa_x != fa_y) { father.put(fa_x, fa_y); } }}
```

## Trie

## Linked List vs ArrayList

`LinkedList` and `ArrayList` are two different implementations of the List interface. `LinkedList` implements it with a doubly-linked list. `ArrayList` implements it with a dynamically re-sizing array.

`LinkedList ` allows for **constant-time insertions or removals** using iterators, but only sequential access of elements.

`ArrayList `, on the other hand, allow **fast random read access**, so you can grab any element in constant time.

# Data Structures

## Array

Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements that have a contiguous memory location.

**Java array** is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0 index.

## Advantages

- **Code Optimization:** It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
- **Random access:** We can get any data located at an index position

## Disadvantages

**Size Limit:** We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

## Types of Array

There are two types of array.

- Single Dimensional Array
- Multidimensional Array

## Example

```
//Java Program to illustrate how to declare, instantiate, initialize
```

```
//and traverse the Java array.
```

```
class Testarray{
```

```
public static void main(String args[]){
```

```
int a[]=new int[5]; //declaration and instantiation
```

```
a[0]=10; //initialization
```

```
a[1]=20;
```

```
a[2]=70;
```

```
a[3]=40;
```

```
a[4]=50;
```

```
//traversing array
```

```
for(int i=0;i arrli = new ArrayList ();
```

Note : More examples are given below.

## The Set Interface

- A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction.
- The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited.
- Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ.

## The Map Interface

The Map interface maps unique keys to values. A key is an object that you use to retrieve a value at a later date.

- Given a key and a value, you can store the value in a Map object. After the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key.
- Several methods throw a NoSuchElementException when no items exist in the invoking map.
- A ClassCastException is thrown when an object is incompatible with the elements in a map.
- A NullPointerException is thrown if an attempt is made to use a null object and null is not allowed in the map.
- An UnsupportedOperationException is thrown when an attempt is made to change an unmodifiable map.

## Example of List, Set, Map

```
import java.util.*; // All the classes and interfaces are part of the util package
```

```
public class CollectionsDemo {
```

```
 public static void main(String[] args) {
```

```
 // ArrayList
```

```
 List a1 = new ArrayList();
```

```
 a1.add("Zara");
```

```
 a1.add("Mahnaz");
```

```
 a1.add("Ayan");
```

```
 System.out.println(" ArrayList Elements"... [Content truncated for context window]

## Linear Data Structures – Lists

Array, Linked List (Single, Double, Circular), Stack, Queue

## Hierarchical – Trees

Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), B-Tree, Red-Black Tree

## How Data Structures are used

Storage structures (arrays, linked structures, hash tables)

process-oriented data structures (stacks, queues, priority queues, iterators), and descriptive data structures (collections, sets, linear lists, binary trees, etc.)

## Complex Structures

Priority Queues

Hash Tables

## Graph

“Nearly all graph problems will somehow use a grid or network in the problem, but sometimes these will be well disguised. Secondly, if you are required to find a path of any sort, it is usually a graph problem as well. Some common keywords associated with graph problems are: vertices, nodes, edges, connections, connectivity, paths, cycles and direction.” -TopCoder

“They can range in difficulty from finding a path on a 2D grid from a start location to an end location, to something as hard as finding the maximum amount of water that you can route through a set of pipes, each of which has a maximum capacity (also known as the maximum-flow minimum-cut problem)” -TopCoder

“An example of one of the simplest types of graphs is a singly linked list!” -TopCoder

A tree only allows a node to have children, and there cannot be any loops in the tree, with a more general graph we can represent many different situations.

[TopCoder – Introduction to Graphs and Their Data Structures](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/introduction-to-graphs-and-their-data-structures-section-1/)

## Matrix

A multi-dimensional array.

Uses:

– To represent class hierarchy using Boolean square matrix

– For data encryption and decryption

– To represent traffic flow and plumbing in a network

– To implement graph theory of node representation

An adjacency matrix is often used in the representation of graphs as an alternative to adjacency lists

# The Role of Data Structures in Programming

Data structures are the building blocks of any software application. As a developer, understanding and utilizing the right data structures is essential for efficient and optimized code. In this article, we will explore the power of data structures, their advantages, and how they can enhance your development process.

## Unleashing the Power of Data Structures: A Developer's Guide

### The Importance of Data Structures

Data structures define how data is organized, stored, and accessed within a program. Choosing the appropriate data structure for your application can greatly impact its performance and scalability. Here are a few key reasons why data structures are crucial for developers:

- **Efficiency:** By selecting the right data structure, you can improve the performance and speed of your code. Efficient data structures reduce the time complexity of operations such as searching, inserting, and deleting elements.
- **Memory Optimization:** Data structures help optimize memory usage by storing and organizing data in the most efficient way possible. This ensures that your application consumes the least amount of memory while still providing the required functionality.
- **Organization and Maintenance:** Well-defined data structures make code more readable and maintainable. They provide a clear representation of how data is structured, making it easier to understand and modify code as needed.
- **Scalability:** A well-designed data structure can handle large amounts of data and allow your application to scale seamlessly without compromising performance.

### Types of Data Structures

There are several types of data structures available, each tailored for specific use cases. Let's take a closer look at some commonly used data structures:

#### 1\. Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest and most fundamental data structures. They store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type, accessible by their index. Arrays provide fast access to elements but have a fixed size, making them less flexible for dynamic data.

#### 2\. Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node. They allow dynamic memory allocation, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of data may vary. Linked lists excel in insertions and deletions, but sequential access can be slower compared to arrays.

#### 3\. Stacks

Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They allow adding and removing elements only from the top. Stacks are commonly used in programming languages for function calls, recursion, and handling undo/redo operations.

#### 4\. Queues

Queues implement t... [Content truncated for context window]

# 6 Essential Data Structures Java Programmer should Learn

Hello guys, Data Structure is a building block of programs. It's even said that **"Data Structure + Algorithms= Program"**. That's why a good knowledge of data structure is very important for any programmers, including Java developers. Data structure gives you the option to store your data so that you can access it based on your requirement. For example, if you want a fast search based upon the username then you can use [HashMap](https://www.java67.com/2013/02/10-examples-of-hashmap-in-java-programming-tutorial.html), but that's only possible if you know data structure and their implementations in the programming language you are using, and that's what you will learn in this article.

Java API provides built-in support for common data structures, essential for writing programs like an array, linked list, map, set, stack, and queue. You don't need to implement these data structures by yourself, you can directly use them in your program, thanks to the rich and efficient implementation provided by Java API.

This is also one reason [why Java is the best programming language](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/04/10-reasons-to-learn-java-programming.html). Since data structure is core to any program and the choice of a particular data structure significantly affects both the functionality and performance of Java applications, it's worth an effort to explore different data structures available in Java.

Many of these data structure is part of the hugely popular Java Collection Framework, and almost all Java programs maybe, except [hello world](http://java67.blogspot.sg/2013/03/helloworld-in-java-how-to-write-compile-example-tutorial.html) make use of Collection in one or another form.

In this Java tutorial, we will take a look at a standard data structure. Array, linked list, Stack, Queue, Map, ... [Content truncated for context window]
