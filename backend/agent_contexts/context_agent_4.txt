# Potatoes
General Information:
Potatoes are an important food source. They are the most widely cultivated vegetable in the world. An average-sized potato weighing between 6 and 8 ounces contains fewer than 100 calories. Potatoes consist of about 80 percent water, 20 percent solid matter and have a high nutritional value. Starch makes up about 85 percent of this solid mass and the rest is protein. Potatoes provide vitamins including niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, and vitamin C. They also contain minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur.
Selection and Storage:
Potatoes, regardless of their variety, should be well shaped, firm with relatively smooth skin and only a few shallow eyes. Pick those with good color without cuts, dark or soft spots, wrinkles or wilted skin or any that have started to sprout. Store in burlap, brown paper, or perforated plastic bags away from light, in the coolest, non-refrigerated and well-ventilated part of the house.
Preparation and Cooking:
Remove any deep eyes, sprouts or green spots and scrub under cold water before cooking. Potatoes can be baked, boiled, steamed, fried, microwaved or grilled.

| [From UK online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1206765/Why-potatoes-suprising-health-benefit-key-lasting-weight-loss.html) The Incredible Edible Potato - Is Nutritious **Provides many RDA's of Nutrition** Inside its red, yellow, white or brown skin, a potato can provide many of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of a number of vitamins and minerals. **For example:** Potatoes contain about 620 mg of potassium-that's more than a banana. Potassium is essential to the body because it helps to attain a high level of muscle performance and improves the nerves' response to stimulation. **Since Potatoes grow under ground it is no surprise they contain minerals like Iron**... Iron is essential in helping the body convert food to energy as well helping us to resist infection. **However they also get sunshine nutrients.....** Vitamins - such as vitamin C, the sunshine vitamin. Vitamin C is essential in maintaining healthy connective tissue and heal wounds. (Got aches from arthritis? Increase your C, another reason for a potato...) **Varieties of potatoes are also good sources of B vitamins** B vitamins help the body make healthy red blood cells and amino acids. **Potatoes contain no fat or cholesterol** and minimal sodium. (so get out the Mrs. Dash and leave the extra salt behind!) Potatoes contain natural fiber in the skins After a good scrub, those skins are delicious with a little olive oil on them, making them tender and easy to eat. **Protien Packed Potatoes** 1 six-ounce potato contains 3 grams of highly digestible protein. That is almost as much as half a glass of milk. Because of the variety of potato colors, shapes, sizes and textures and their versatility as recipe ingredients, why not include them for any meal? \-\-\----------------------------- **Carb Facts** Although diabetics need to watch the carbs very carefully here is a few facts about Carbs... Carbohydrates DO NOT cause weight gain and obesity Carbohydrates DO NOT automatically cause blood sugar "spikes" and insulin "surges" Carbohydrates DO NOT cause diabetes, heart disease or cancer Carbohydrates are the body's primary fuel source. Muscles prefer them and the brain relies on them. Carbohydrates are so vital to the body that if you severely cut them from your diet, your body will begin to breakdown muscle and other protein-containing tissues - such as your heart and other essential organs - in order to make them. |

When it comes to superfoods, most people might think of exotic fruits or rare vegetables. But in truth, Potatoes are good for your health. They are one of the most underrated and accessible superfoods. Often dismissed as a simple starch, potatoes have a fascinating history and are brimming with essential nutrients.

## Historical Significance of Potatoes

The history of potatoes dates back to over 10,000 years ago. Potatoes were first domesticated in the Andes region of South America. Native to countries like Peru and Bolivia, the potato was a staple food for ancient civilizations like the Incas. Spanish explorers brought potatoes to Europe in the 16th century and they spread globally. Becoming a vital crop for many nations and sustaining human development for years to come.

Indigenous Australian’s have been eating potatoes or a species of them known as [Yams](https://www.anthropologyfromtheshed.com/yam-lands-the-mystery-of-a-holey-landscape) (Murnong) for over 65,000 years. These plants were readily available and an important part of traditional diets until colonisation nearly brought the Yam to extinction. [Murnong 8 times more nutritious](https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2018/02/27/native-superfood-8-times-nutritious-potato-and-tastes-sweet-coconut) and sweeter than average white potatoes. Yet we still don’t see it in our supermarkets or fresh food grocers.

![Potatoes Are Good for Your Health](https://www.vallone.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Image-source-httpwww.froebeldecade.comyam-daisy.jpg)

During the 19th century, the potato played a crucial role in combating food scarcity and famine in Europe. Particularly in Ireland during the [infamous Irish Potato Famine](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/overview/the-great-famine/#:~:text=Between%201845%2D52%20Ireland%20suffered,population%20was%20dependent%20for%20food.). The tuber’s ability to grow in diverse climates and its high nutritional value made it a lifeline for millions. Today, potatoes remain a dietary staple for millions worldwide.
