### Source 31: How to Become a Python Developer (2025 Guide)

**Content:**
As there is no specific background or experience required for you to become a Python Developer, there are a number of ways you can enter the field. It all starts, however, with a specific set of skills, and more specifically, a mastery of the Python programming language.

Many Developers find that the Python programming language has a lot of features that give it an edge over other programming languages.

For instance, easy syntax and readability makes learning Python a lot easier, which should help you boost your skills with Python relatively quickly. And based on Stack Overflow question views in World Bank high-income countries, Python is only rising in popularity among programming languages.

**How to Become a Python Developer in Three Steps:**

1. [Learn to read and write in Python](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#learn-to-read-and-write-in-the-python-programming-language)
2. [Work on projects with Python to develop your skills](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#work-on-projects-with-python-to-develop-your-skills)
3. [Develop a portfolio of projects completed with Python](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-a-python-developer#develop-a-portfolio-of-projects-completed-with-python)

## 1\. Learn to Read and Write in Python

Since Python is relatively easy and intuitive for newcomers to learn, a Python Programming course, [online tutorial](https://brainstation.io/learn/python), or [coding bootcamp](https://brainstation.io/) could help you quickly learn how to read and write in the language and leave you feeling like a Python pro in a very short period of time.

Because Python is a versatile, general-purpose, and extremely popular programming language, it’s often considered the **best first language for newcomers to learn**.

It’s an excellent choice as an introductory language because it is concise and easy to read, even for people with no experience with coding or computer science. And since it’s so widely useful — it can be used for everything from web development to software development or even scientific applications — it’s really a language any programmer should have in his or her stack.

Python is also one of the most widely used languages for Back-End Developers, Data Scientists, and Machine Learning Engineers.

_Because Python has so many applications, Python skills can be valuable to a number of other job roles, even if you have only basic knowledge of how it works._

And because it’s relatively straightforward, some courses promise they can make you a Python professional in as little time as 25 hours.

BrainStation, for example, offers a part-time online [Python Programming Course](https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming).

### Source 35: Python For Beginners

**Content:**
**Notice:** While JavaScript is not essential for this website, your interaction with the content will be limited. Please turn JavaScript on for the full experience.

Welcome! Are you [completely new to programming](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)?
If _not_ then we presume you will be looking for information about
why and how to get started with Python.
Fortunately an
experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be)
can pick up Python very quickly.
It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so
[jump in](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)!

# Installing

Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays
many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python.
Even
some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python
already installed.
If you _do_ need to install Python and aren't confident about the
task you can find
a few notes on the
[BeginnersGuide/Download](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

# Learning

Before getting started, you may want to find out which [IDEs](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) and [text\
editors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) are tailored to make
Python editing easy, browse the list of [introductory books](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks), or look at [code samples](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples) that you might find
helpful.

There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the
[BeginnersGuide/Tutorials](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
page. There is also a list of
[resources in other languages](https://www.python.org/doc/nonenglish/)
which might be useful if English is not your first language.

The [online documentation](http://docs.python.org)
is your first port of call for definitive information.
There is a fairly brief
[tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
that gives you basic information about the language and
gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the
[library reference](http://docs.python.org/3/library/)
for a full description of Python's many libraries and the
[language reference](http://docs.python.org/3/reference/) for
a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax.
If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you
can browse the [ActiveState Python Cookbook](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/)

# Looking for Something Specific?

If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library
with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a
number of possible sources of information. The Python web site
provides a
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=index)
(also known as the _Cheese Shop_, a reference to the Monty Python
script of that name).

# Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it is dynamically typed and uses indentation to define code blocks, making it beginner-friendly and easy to maintain. Python is used across various domains, including web development, data science, automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, thanks to its extensive standard library and powerful third-party frameworks like Django, Flask, pandas, and TensorFlow. Its cross-platform nature, large community support, and open-source status have made it one of the most popular and widely adopted programming languages today.

Python offers a vast ecosystem of libraries that extend its functionality across various domains. Popular libraries include **NumPy** and **pandas** for data manipulation, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization, and **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for machine learning and AI. For web development, frameworks like **Flask** and **Django** are widely used, while **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** help with web scraping. Other useful libraries include **requests** for HTTP requests, **SQLAlchemy** for database interaction, **pygame** for game development, and **OpenCV** for computer vision. Python's rich...
