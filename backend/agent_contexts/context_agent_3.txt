### Source 6: What is Machine Learning? ML Tutorial for Beginners

**Content:**
[‘Funmi](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/Heyfunmi/)

The term “Machine Learning” was coined by a computer gamer named Arthur Samuel in 1959. He defined it like this:

> "\[Machine learning is a\] Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn and make predictions without being explicitly programmed."

ML is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. It's based on the idea that computers can learn from historical experiences, make vital decisions, and predict future happenings without human intervention.

Machine Learning is behind product suggestions on e-commerce sites, your movie suggestions on Netflix, and so many more things. The computer is able to make these suggestions and predictions by learning from your previous data input and past experiences.

In recent years, Machine Learning has garnered a lot of attention around the world, it has become one of the most important ways that people use Artificial Intelligence.

## How Does Machine Learning Work?

Machine Learning involves building algorithms. Data Scientists build these algorithms, and the type of algorithm they build depends on the type of data they're working on.

The Machine Learning process begins with gathering data (numbers, text, photos, comments, letters, and so on). These data, often called “training data,” are used in training the Machine Learning algorithm. Training essentially "teaches" the algorithm how to learn by using tons of data.

Following the end of the “training”, new input data is then fed into the algorithm and the algorithm uses the previously developed model to make predictions.

The algorithm is trained several times until it reaches a desired outcome. This enables the Machine Learning algorithms to continually learn on their own. This produces optimal answers and increasing accuracy and predictions over time.

Here's a helpful [overview of Machine Learning basics for developers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-basics-for-developers/) to get you started.

## Types Of Machine Learning

There are three types of Machine Learning, which include:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Let's look at each one briefly.

### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised Learning is the most common type of Machine Learning. It involves training the algorithm with a “labelled” dataset. The labelled training data helps the Machine Learning algorithm make accurate predictions in the future.

A practical example of supervised learning is training a Machine Learning algorithm with pictures of an apple. After that training, the algorithm is able to identify and retain this information and is able to give accurate predictions of an apple in the future. That is, it will typically be able to correctly identify if an image is of an apple.

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

In Unsupervised Learning, the training data is **NOT** labelled or named. The unlabeled data are used in training the Machine Learning algorith... [Content truncated for context window]
