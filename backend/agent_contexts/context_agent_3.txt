## **Introduction to Basic Data Structures and Algorithms**

Before introducing data structures we should understand that computers do store, retrieve, and process a large amount of data. If the data is stored in well organized way on storage media and in computer's memory then it can be accessed quickly for processing that further reduces the latency and the user is provided fast response.

Data structure introduction refers to a scheme for organizing data, or in other words a data structure is an arrangement of data in computer's memory in such a way that it could make the data quickly available to the processor for required calculations. A data structure should be seen as a logical concept that must address two fundamental concerns. First, how the data will be stored, and second, what operations will be performed on it? As data structure is a scheme for data organization so the functional definition of a data structure should be independent of its implementation. The functional definition of a data structure is known as ADT (Abstract Data Type) which is independent of implementation. The implementation part is left on develope...

A data structure known as a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **data structure** is a [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) organization and storage format that is usually chosen for [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) [access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access) to data.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3) More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)) or [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)) that can be applied to the data,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-4) i.e., it is an [algebraic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure) about [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data).

## Usage

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_structure&action=edit&section=1)\]

Data structures serve as the basis for [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-5)

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) commonly use [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) indexes for data retrieval,[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-6) while [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) [implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation) usually use [hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to look up [identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_(computer_languages)).[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-7)

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) and internet indexing services.

## What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way of formatting data so that it can be used by a computer program or other system. Data structures are a fundamental component of computer science because they give form to abstract [data](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data) points. In this way, they allow users and systems to efficiently organize, work with and store data.

Data structures combine primitive data types such as numbers, characters, booleans and integers into a cohesive format. Alone, each of these primitive data types possesses only a single value. When they are combined in a data structure, they enable higher-level data operations such as sorting, searching, insertion and deletion.

For example, consider a sales team that wants to track daily sales figures. Instead of logging each data point separately, the team could store this data in a type of data structure called an "array." (For more information, see "Types of data structures").

In Python, the array might look like this:

**daily\_sales** = \[500, 800, 600, 1200, 950\]

Using an array enables the team to keep all this data together, easily retrieve data points when needed and perform functions on both individual elements and the whole array.

Computer programmers rely on data structures to build effective applications. In the fields of computer science and [data science](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-science?), data structures are essential to operating systems, [databases](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/database), websites, graphics, [analytics](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/big-data-analytics?), [blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/blockchain?), [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning?) applications and more.

Because data structures are fundamental to writing effective code, they are often among the first lessons taught to beginners of programming. They are also a common topic of interview questions for computer programming job candidates.

## Why are data structures important?

Data structures are important because they make it easier for computers to process large, complex sets of information. By logically organizing data elements, data structures increase the efficiency of computer code and make the code simpler to understand.

A data structure is a model where data is organized, managed and stored in a format that enables efficient access and modification of data. There are various types of data structures commonly available. It is up to the programmer to choose which data structure to use depending on the data.

The choice of a particular one can be considered based on the following points:

1. It must be able to process the data efficiently when necessary.
2. It must be able to represent the inherent relationship of the data in the real world.

## Why study Data Structures?

> “Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.”
>
> Linus Torvalds

Time and energy are both required to process any instruction. Every CPU cycle that is saved will have an effect on both the time and energy consumed and can be put to better use in processing other instructions.

A program built using improper data structures will be therefore inefficient or unnecessarily complex. It is necessary to have a good knowledge of data structures and understand where to use the best one. The study includes the description, implementation and quantitative performance analysis of the data structure.

## Concept of a Data Type

### Primitive Data Types

A primitive data type is one that is inbuilt into the programming language for defining the most basic types of data. These may be different for the various programming languages available. For example, the C programming language has inbuilt support for characters (char), integers (int, long) and real numbers (float, double).

### User-Defined Data Type

User-defined data type, as the name suggests is the one that the user defines as per the requirements of the data to be stored. Most programming languages provide support for creating user-defined data types. For example, C provides support through structures (struct), unions (union) and enumerations (enum).

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

Abstract Data Types are defined by its behaviour from the point of view of the user of the data. It defines it in terms of possible values, operations on data, and the behaviour of these operations.

The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. That is, it does not specify how the data is being handled under the hood. This concept is known as abstraction.

For eg. The user of the stack data structure only knows about the push and pop operations in a stack. They do not care how the push operation interacts with the memory to store the data. They only expect it to store it in the way specified.

## Common Operations in a Data Structure

A data structure is only useful when you can perform operations on it, right? These are the basic operations that should be able to be performed on every data structure.

This operation handles how the element... [Content truncated for context window]

# Data Structure Definition

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | A _data structure_ is a way of storing [information](https://linfo.org/information.html) in a computer so that it can be used _efficiently_. Efficiency in this context refers to the ability to find and manipulate data quickly and with the minimum consumption of computer and [network](https://linfo.org/network.html) resources, mainly CPU (central processing unit) time, [memory](https://linfo.org/memory.html) space and [bandwidth](https://linfo.org/bandwidth.html). Numerous types of data structures have been developed; some are very general and widely used, while others are highly specialized for certain types of tasks. Careful selection of data structures can allow the use of the most efficient [_algorithms_](https://linfo.org/algorithm.html) for particular tasks and thereby optimize the performance of [programs](https://linfo.org/program.html). An algorithm is a precise, unambiguous sets of rules that specify how to solve some problem or perform some task. Data structures can be classified in several ways, including whether they are linear or graphic and whether they are static or _dynamic_ (i.e., whether the shape or size of the structure changes over time). Linear data structures include _lists_ and _associative arrays_. List data structures can be divided into _arrays_, _linked lists_ and _V lists_. Graph data structures include _trees_, _adjacency lists_, _disjoint-sets_, _graph-structured stacks_ and _scene graphs_. Other data structures include _frames_, _unions_, _tagged unions_ and _tables_. Most data structures are formed from two or more of just four basic types of components: _arrays_, _discriminated unions_, _records_ and _references_. For example, linked lists are constructed from records and _nullable references_. A nullable reference is a reference that can be _null_ (i.e., the actual value of an item is missing, unknown, or not applicable), and it is a combination of references and discriminated unions. Linked lists are the simplest data structures. Each consists of a sequence of _nodes_, each of which contains arbitrary data fields and one or two references (i.e., _links_) pointing to the next and/or previous nodes. Linked lists permit insertion and removal of the nodes at any point in the list, but they do not allow random access. _Trees_ are a widely-used data structure that resembles an inverted biological tree structure. Each node can have any number of _child nodes_, which are below it in the tree diagram. Most tree structures are _ordered trees_, which make a distinction between the various _children_ of a node, whereas ordered trees make such a distinction. One of the most commonly used data structures is the _B-tree_, which is a type of tree structure that is very efficient for insertions and deletions and for keeping data sorted. Thus it is employed as the basis for [filesystems](https://linfo.org/filesystem.html), databas... [Content truncated for context window]
