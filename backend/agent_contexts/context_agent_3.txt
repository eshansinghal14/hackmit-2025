Coding has become the **new literacy for 21st century**. Everyone in the 21st century will have to **learn to code**.

**So, what is coding?** Coding is basically writing instructions which can be understood by computers to accomplish certain task. Task can be anything like generating prime numbers, sending email to all employee in the organization whose email addresses are stored in excel sheet, detecting human face in given image to auto tagging person in Facebook post by recognizing face from uploaded photo.

Learning to code **increases your productivity and it is still a fun creative skill**. To code, we need to know programming languages. Programming languages are basic building block for creating software.

Programming languages allow us to write code (instructions) which can be processed or understood by computer.

This course uses the python programming language. Python programming language is the best **first language** to learn because it has **simple elegant syntax and gentle learning curve** (you can write and understand python code quickly and easily).

## Python Tutorial

Welcome! to the Python tutorial.

If you are new to programming or an intermediate programmer and want to learn the new generation language **Python** then start now right here.

We will cover topics of python in every detail and yet very easy to understand. We believe in learning with examples so you will see lots of examples with pictures which clears your concept very easily.

We also have an FAQ at the end of each topic for you in any doubt.

* * *

## What is Python?

**Python is a widely used high-level programming language**. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java. However, Python is much more flexible, powerful, and readable than these other systems.

Python is so versatile that it can be used to write a simple computer program to create a complex AI algorithm.

Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and **integrate your systems** more effectively. You can use Python as your base language for your own applications, either interactively in a text editor or non-interactively as a scripting language.

![python tutorial](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/assets/python/python-tutorial.webp)

Python is an **interpreted language**. This means that Python is read as a sequence of characters, and the interpreter does the work of translating the characters into the appropriate actions. This allows Python to be a very powerful language, but also means that Python is not a compiled language. Compiled languages are typically compiled to machine code, which is faster and more efficient than source code.

Python is a **free and open-source language**.

Python is **multi-platform**.

Python is **cross-platform**.

Python support multiple [programming paradigms](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/programming-paradigm) like Object Oriented, Procedure Functional, etc.

Python is the most useful programming language of the current era. It was created by **Guido Van Rossum** and was released in the year 1991.

Python is a **dynamic programming language** and has an **automatic memory management system**, which means it requires less rigid coding and hence is a beginner-friendly language.

The motive of python language is to let programmers and developers focus on creating logic rather than worrying about syntax memory management.

Python is very **rich in its standard libraries** it is also called to be "batteries included" because of this.

### Python Example Codes

The python code syntax is very easy to read, write and understand.

python codes are so easy that you can understand code very much just by reading it.

To print something on the screen you just have to use the `print` method in python.

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Output:

```
Hello World!
```

Similarly repeating a task by creating a loop in python is also easy and readable.

**Content:**
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that has gained immense popularity since its creation by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and its official release in 1991. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is designed to emphasize code clarity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers alike.

### **Key Features of Python**

- **Readability**: Python's syntax closely resembles English, which makes it easier to understand and write code. This focus on readability allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.

- **Versatility**: Python is a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles. This flexibility enables developers to choose the approach that best suits their project needs.

- **Interpreted Language**: As an interpreted language, Python executes code line by line, which simplifies debugging and allows for rapid prototyping. This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners who are learning programming concepts.

- **Extensive Libraries**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that supports various tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. There are also numerous third-party libraries available that extend its functionality even further.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable.


### **Applications of Python**

Python's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications:

- **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask enable developers to build robust web applications efficiently.

- **Data Science and Machine Learning**: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow make Python a popular choice for data analysis and machine learning projects.

- **Automation and Scripting**: Python is often used for automating repetitive tasks and system scripting due to its ease of use.

- **Game Development**: Tools like Pygame allow developers to create games using Python.

- **Scientific Computing**: Python is widely used in scientific research for simulations and complex calculations due to libraries like SciPy.


### **Getting Started with Python**

To begin programming in Python, you can download the latest version from the official Python website. You can write Python code using a simple text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. Here’s a basic example of a Python program:

Copy

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

This simple program outputs "Hello, World!" to the console, demonstrating how easy it is to get started with Python.

Strings Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. 'hello'  is the same as  "hello" . You can display a string literal with the  print()  function: Example print ( "Hello" ) print ( 'Hello' ) Try it Yourself » Quotes Inside Quotes You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: Example print ( "It's alright" ) print ( "He is called 'Johnny'" ) print ( 'He is called "Johnny"' ) Try it Yourself » ADVERTISEMENT Assign String to a Variable Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string: Example a =  "Hello" print (a) Try it Yourself » Multiline Strings You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes: Example You can use three double quotes: a =  "" "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisc...

What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting. What can Python do? Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. Why Python? Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very qui...
