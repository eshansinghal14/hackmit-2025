### Source 21: Are Potatoes Healthy?

**Content:**
Of all the vegetables Americans eat, potatoes are among the most popular – the average American eats about 55 pounds of potatoes a year. Some people call potatoes diet-wreckers. But others say they’re fine to eat.

Registered dietitian Andrea Dunn, RD, explains the benefits of potatoes and how you can enjoy them without sabotaging your healthy eating goals.

### Are potatoes a vegetable?

Are potatoes a vegetable or a starch? This age-old question can lead to arguments about their health benefits. After all, calling something a vegetable seems to magically change it into a healthier food.

“Potatoes are put in the [starchy vegetable](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/4-starches-that-dont-belong-on-your-plate/) category, due to the amount of carbohydrates they contain,” says Dunn. “But they are a type of vegetable and they contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.”

### Starchy vs. non-starchy vegetables

The two main types of vegetables are starchy and non-starchy. Starch is a type of carbohydrate that we find in lots of foods. Other types of carbs are fiber and sugar.

Starchy vegetables are higher in total carbohydrates than their non-starchy counterparts. Usually, this means starchy veggies are higher in calories, too. Other starchy vegetables include:

- Butternut squash.
- Corn and peas.
- Sweet potatoes.
- Lentils and beans.

Non-starchy vegetables include:

- Asparagus.
- Broccoli.
- Green beans.
- Leafy greens.
- Onions.
- Peppers.
- Tomatoes.

But the higher calorie content doesn’t make potatoes a diet no-no. Like any food, potatoes are fine to eat in moderation.

“Healthy food choices should include a variety of starchy and non-starchy vegetables,” says Dunn. “In fact, the new [Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/) includes up to 5 cups a week of starchy vegetables for those needing 2,000 calories a day.”

### Types of potatoes

Potatoes come in many varieties that differ in taste, texture and color. Some of the most common types include:

- Fingerling.
- Purple.
- Red.
- Russet.
- White.
- Yellow.

Each type varies slightly in terms of its vitamin and mineral content. But the differences are pretty small.

And sweet potatoes aren’t a type of potato, despite their name. “Sweet potatoes come from a different plant family than potatoes so their nutrition content is different,” says Dunn. “One of the main differences is that sweet potatoes contain vitamin A and white potatoes don’t.”

**Potato nutrition**

Wondering if potatoes measure up to other veggies in terms of nutrition? One medium-sized russet potato baked with skin offers:

- 25% of daily potassium.
- 35% of daily vitamin C.
- 30% of daily vitamin B6.
- four grams of fiber.
- five grams of protein.

To get the full nutrition, don’t peel your potatoes. “The skin has half of the potato’s fiber content and many of its nutrients,” says Dunn.

## America’s Favorite Vegetable

**How Potatoes Grow:**

American potatoes are grown from certified seed potatoes developed by world-class potato breeding programs and must pass the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s seed certification system.

After the potato seeds are planted, over the course of a few months, 5-20 tubers will start to grow per plant. To dig up the potatoes, farmers use advanced machines to carefully remove the potatoes out of the ground and separate the potatoes from other plant material, dirt, and rocks. The potatoes are then gently transported to different facilities.

To learn more about planting and harvesting, check out this video.

## Potato Facts You Might Not Know

### Sustainability

Potatoes are good for a healthy, sustainable earth. Potatoes produce more food energy per cubic meter of water used than any other major crop and use less land per kilogram of production than most other foods. Potato farmers use sustainable growing techniques to ensure healthy crops generation after generation. Learn more about potato sustainability [here](https://potatogoodness.ph/potato-sustainability/).

### White Potatoes vs. Sweet Potatoes

Both regular potatoes and sweet potatoes are remarkably similar on many key nutrients. For example, a white potato has 620mg of potassium per serving while a sweet potato has 440mg of potassium per serving. Click [here](https://potatogoodness.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/White-Potato-vs.-Sweet-Potato-Nutrition-Facts-1.jpg) for a side-by-side comparison of these two vegetables. [Potassium](https://potatogoodness.ph/potatoes-potassium-rich-foods/) is particularly important because less than 3% of Americans get enough of this key nutrient, and research suggests that diets rich in potassium and low in sodium reduce the risk of hypertension and stroke.

### Diabetes

According to the [American Diabetes Association](https://www.diabetes.org/tools-support/diabetes-prevention/diabetes-myths) (ADA), starchy vegetables like potatoes can be included in the diets of people with diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates consumed at any given meal or snack is what is most important.

Potatoes are a nutritional bargain. A 5 1/3-ounce potato (about the size of a standard computer mouse) has 100 calories, no fat, 26 grams carbohydrate, 3 grams fiber, 21% of the daily recommendation for potassium, 45% of the daily recommendation for vitamin C, and other nutrients. Nutrition labels are based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet, so a potato would provide 1/20 of the daily calorie needs for an average adult.

The complex carbohydrates in potatoes provide energy to fuel our muscles and brain. However, potato toppings can add excess calories and fat. For example, a 100-calorie potato with no fat becomes a “stuffed potato” with 463 calories and 35 grams of fat when you add 2 tablespoons of butter, ¼ cup of cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons of bacon bits. Consider using “reduced fat” or “light” products or use smaller amounts of higher-fat/calorie toppings.

# POTATO PLANT

Potatoes are grown as annual plants, with fields planted each spring, and harvested in the fall. All potato plants look something like the picture here. The part of the plant we call a “potato” grows underground. It grows on a specialized underground stem called a stolon. So, although potatoes grow underground, they are stems, not roots, and are known as “tubers.”

It is surprising to many people that potato plants produce flowers – sometimes very attractive ones. The fruits that grow from these flowers look a lot like green tomatoes, but they are not edible.

There are many different kinds of potatoes grown in Washington. Most of them are brown-skinned with white flesh, and are called “russets.” Russet Burbank is the most common variety of russet potato. It is grown for French fries and for the fresh market. Other russet varieties include Ranger Russet (grown for French fries) and Russet Norkotah (grown for fresh potatoes sold by supermarkets and baked by restaurants). Other varieties grown in Washington produce yellow, red, and blue potatoes. Other varieties are grown specifically to be made into potato chips. For more information on potato varieties in Washington, see the Recipes section of our web site.

## PRODUCTION SYSTEM

Most potatoes grown in Washington are grown in large fields of over 100 acres (there are 640 acres in a square mile). Almost all potatoes grown in Washington have to be watered with sprinklers, known as “irrigation.”

There just isn’t enough rain in Washington during the summer to grow potatoes without irrigation. Many fields in Washington are irrigated using sprinkler systems called “center pivots.” These machines pivot around a center point, and can irrigate fields well over 100 acres in size. Electricity is used to drive motors on each pair of wheels. Complicated computerized control panels ensure an even water supply for all the plants in the field.

Many plant diseases can infect potatoes. To help minimize their loss to diseases, farmers usually grow potatoes in each field once in every four years. The three seasons between potato crops allow time for potato-infecting diseases to die out in that field.

Prior to planting, growers determine how fertile the soil in their field is. They have the soil analyzed to determine how much nitrogen, phosphorous, and other essential plant nutrients it contains. Then the grower orders a fertilizer mix specially tailored to the needs of their particular field. This will allow them to grow a high-quality potato crop without wasting fertilizer (which costs them money).

## Potato Nutrition Facts

{Play}

### POTASSIUM

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, potassium is also a nutrient of concern – because very few of us are getting enough. With 620 milligrams in a medium potato, this white vegetable is a potassium superstar! One serving of potatoes can provide 18% of the DV for potassium – meaning it is an excellent source of this key nutrient. A medium potato has significantly more potassium than a medium banana (420 mgs.), often touted for its potassium content, and much more per serving than other produce items, including broccoli at 460 mgs. and sweet potatoes at 440 mgs.

{Play}

### FIBER

Most Americans eat only half the recommended amount of daily fiber. This is a nutrient of public health concern and potatoes can help fill that gap. A medium potato with skin has about 2 grams of fiber. Many people think of the skin as the high fiber portion of the potato; however, about two-thirds of the total fiber content is inside, in the delicious flesh of the potato! Supplying 8% of the Daily Value (DV) for fiber, a medium potato has about the same amount of fiber as 1/2 grapefruit or 1 raw carrot and much more than most leafy vegetables.

{Play}

### ANTIOXIDANTS

In addition to vitamins and minerals, research documented by Potatoes USA shows potatoes contain an assortment of phytochemicals with antioxidant potential, most notably carotenoids and anthocyanins. According to Potatoes USA’s Nutritional Handbook, anthocyanins are found in the greatest quantities in purple and red potatoes while carotenoids are found largely in yellow and red potatoes. Also referenced in Potatoes USA’s Nutritional Handbook; a research study examined the total antioxidant capacity of more than 100 different foods including fruits, vegetables, nuts and more. Researchers found that out of the 42 vegetables that were tested, Russet potatoes ranked fifth highest in their total antioxidant levels, coming in behind small red beans, kidney beans, pinto beans and artichokes. However, potatoes scored higher than other vegetables often more commonly known for their antioxidant potential including broccoli, cabbage and tomatoes.

{Play}While most Americans get enough vitamin C, it is vital for iron absorption, wound healing and gum health. The vitamin C content of a medium potato is about 27 milligrams – or 45% of the DV, making it an excellent source of this key antioxidant that is also thought to support immune system health. This means that a medium potato has about the same vitamin C as a medium tangerine and a bit more than a medium tomato. It is also a good reason to cook potatoes in their skins, to retain as much vitamin C and other water soluble vitamins as possible.

{Play}Yes, potatoes have some surprisingly high quality protein. A medium potato has 3 grams of protein, more than most vegetables and about the same amount as 1/3 cup of milk. The quality of the potato protein, including how easy it is to digest and the amino ac... [Content truncated for context window]

# How to grow potatoes in New Zealand

The humble potato, rich in iron and potassium, is a staple on the dinner tables around New Zealand. Roasted, boiled, mashed or in a salad – no matter how you serve yours, homegrown potatoes always taste better dug fresh. Plant only certified seed potatoes for guaranteed disease-free tubers.

## When to grow potatoes

- Plant – August to December
- Harvest – December to March

## Potato varieties to grow in New Zealand

Potato varieties are classed as early, early/main and main. Early varieties are ready in 90 days, main crops 100 days and late crops 120+ days. Early varieties are harvested when the tops are still green, early/main and main crops are harvested when they have finished flowering and the foliage has died down completely.

- Early varieties: Rocket, Cliff Kidney, Jersey Benne, Swift
- Early/main varieties: Nadine, Ilam Hardy, Summer Delight, Summer Beauty
- Main varieties: Rua, Agria, Heather

## Grow your potato plant

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kv5qSsgDVW8?autoplay=0&start=0&rel=0)

Potatoes are frost tender, so start sprouting your tubers in a warm, sunny, spot 4-6 weeks before planting. This is called ‘chitting’. You can plant and grow your potatoes from August-December in New Zealand. In cooler regions plant when the risk of frost has passed.

## Planting potatoes in garden beds

Select a certified seed potato variety and sprout potatoes until the shoots are approximately 2-4cm long. Remove spindly weak shoots. Plant in a well-drained soil in full sun.

### Step 1

Before planting enrich the soil with organic matter by digging in [Scotts Osmocote® Compost & Soil Improver](https://www.lovethegarden.com/nz-en/product/scotts-osmocote-compost-soil-improver-40l) and [Scotts Sheep Pellets](https://www.lovethegarden.com/nz-en/product/scotts-sheep-pellets-5kg), this also adds valuable nutrients to the soil.

### Step 2

Dig a trench (furrow) 10-15cm deep and add a layer of . Place the sprouted seed potatoes in the bottom of the trench with the shoots facing upwards at 25cm spacings.

If planting multiple rows space the trenches (furrows) 30-40cm apart.

### Step 3

Cover the seed potatoes with 5cm of [Scotts Osmocote® Vegetable Mix](https://www.lovethegarden.com/nz-en/product/scotts-osmocote-vegetable-premium-planting-mix-40l) so that the tops of the sprouts are just showing through. Water well. Continue to mound the potatoes as shoots grow to encourage tuber development, until they are approximately 30cm tall.

### Step 4

Continue watering, especially during dry periods. Avoid wetting the foliage - water the soil between the mound.

### Step 5

Feed your potatoes with [Scotts Osmocote® Tomato, Vegetable & Herb Controlled Release Fertiliser](https://www.lovethegarden.com/nz-en/product/scotts-osmocote-controlled-release-fertiliser-vegetable-tomato-herb-garden-beds-500g) to replenish ... [Content truncated for context window]
