Coding has become the **new literacy for 21st century**. Everyone in the 21st century will have to **learn to code**.

**So, what is coding?** Coding is basically writing instructions which can be understood by computers to accomplish certain task. Task can be anything like generating prime numbers, sending email to all employee in the organization whose email addresses are stored in excel sheet, detecting human face in given image to auto tagging person in Facebook post by recognizing face from uploaded photo.

Learning to code **increases your productivity and it is still a fun creative skill**. To code, we need to know programming languages. Programming languages are basic building block for creating software.

Programming languages allow us to write code (instructions) which can be processed or understood by computer.

This course uses the python programming language. Python programming language is the best **first language** to learn because it has **simple elegant syntax and gentle learning curve** (you can write and understand python code quickly and easily).

## Python Tutorial

Welcome! to the Python tutorial.

If you are new to programming or an intermediate programmer and want to learn the new generation language **Python** then start now right here.

We will cover topics of python in every detail and yet very easy to understand. We believe in learning with examples so you will see lots of examples with pictures which clears your concept very easily.

We also have an FAQ at the end of each topic for you in any doubt.

## What is Python?

**Python is a widely used high-level programming language**. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java. However, Python is much more flexible, powerful, and readable than these other systems.

Python is so versatile that it can be used to write a simple computer program to create a complex AI algorithm.

Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and **integrate your systems** more effectively. You can use Python as your base language for your own applications, either interactively in a text editor or non-interactively as a scripting language.

![python tutorial](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/assets/python/python-tutorial.webp)

Python is an **interpreted language**. This means that Python is read as a sequence of characters, and the interpreter does the work of translating the characters into the appropriate actions. This allows Python to be a very powerful language, but also means that Python is not a compiled language. Compiled languages are typically compiled to machine code, which is faster and more efficient than source code.

Python is a **free and open-source language**.

Python is **multi-platform**.

Python is **cross-platform**.

Python support multiple [programming paradigms](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/programming-paradigm) like Object Oriented, Procedure Functional, etc.

Python is the most useful programming language of the current era. It was created by **Guido Van Rossum** and was released in the year 1991.

Python is a **dynamic programming language** and has an **automatic memory management system**, which means it requires less rigid coding and hence is a beginner-friendly language.

The motive of python language is to let programmers and developers focus on creating logic rather than worrying about syntax memory management.

Python is very **rich in its standard libraries** it is also called to be "batteries included" because of this.

### Python Example Codes

The python code syntax is very easy to read, write and understand.

python codes are so easy that you can understand code very much just by reading it.

To print something on the screen you just have to use the `print` method in python.

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Output:

```
Hello World!
```

Similarly repeating a task by creating a loop in python is also easy and readable.

```

# Google's Python Class Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Welcome to Google's Python Class -- this is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. These materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming experience. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections. The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if statement" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this material.

To get started, the Python sections are linked at the left -- [Python Set Up](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) to get Python installed on your machine, [Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) for an introduction to the language, and then [Python Strings](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings) starts the coding material, leading to the first exercise. The end of each written section includes a link to the code exercise for that section's material. The lecture videos parallel the written materials, introducing Python, then strings, then first exercises, and so on. At Google, all this material makes up an intensive 2-day class, so the videos are organized as the day-1 and day-2 sections.

This material was created by [Nick Parlante](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7enick/) working in the engEDU group at Google. Special thanks for the help from my Google colleagues John Cox, Steve Glassman, Piotr Kaminski, and Antoine Picard. And finally thanks to Google and my director Maggie Johnson for the enlightened generosity to put these materials out on the internet for free under the [Creative Commons Attribution 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) license -- share and enjoy!
