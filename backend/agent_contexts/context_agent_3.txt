# ðŸ§®Calculus and Statistics Methods Unit 1 â€“ Calculus Foundations

Calculus Foundations lay the groundwork for understanding how quantities change and accumulate. This unit covers key concepts like limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals, which are essential for modeling real-world phenomena and solving complex problems.
Students learn to analyze functions, calculate rates of change, and find areas under curves. These skills are crucial in fields like physics, engineering, and economics, where calculus is used to optimize designs, predict outcomes, and model dynamic systems.

## Your Mission as Agent 3:
1. Analyze ONLY the research sources assigned to you above
2. Extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from YOUR assigned sources
3. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology
4. Base nodes strictly on the content provided in your sources
5. Focus on the most important and well-supported concepts
6. Ensure nodes are specific and actionable
7. Include both foundational and advanced concepts if present

## Agent Coordination:
- You are Agent 3 of 5 total agents
- Each agent analyzes different sources to avoid duplication
- Your findings will be combined with other agents' results
- Focus on quality over quantity from your assigned sources

## Output Format:
Generate your knowledge nodes in this exact format:

**Agent 3 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. [Node Name]
2. [Node Name]
3. [Node Name]
4. [Node Name]
5. [Node Name]

**Source Summary:**
- Sources Analyzed: 2
- Agent Coverage: 2 of 8 total sources

Generate your specialized knowledge nodes now based strictly on your assigned research sources above.
