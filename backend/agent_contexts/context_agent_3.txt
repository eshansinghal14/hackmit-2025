1 Basic Concepts and Notation
Linear algebra provides a way of compactly representing and operating on sets of linear
equations. For example, consider the following system of equations:
4x1 − 5x2 = −13
−2x1 + 3x2 = 9.
This is two equations and two variables, so as you know from high school algebra, you
can find a unique solution for x1 and x2 (unless the equations are somehow degenerate, for
example if the second equation is simply a multiple of the first, but in the case above there
is in fact a unique solution). In matrix notation, we can write the system more compactly
as
Ax = b
with
A =

### Source 6: An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra – BetterExplained

**Content:**
Despite two linear algebra classes, my knowledge consisted of “Matrices, determinants, eigen something something”.

Why? Well, let’s try this course format:

- Name the course _Linear Algebra_ but focus on things called matrices and vectors
- Teach concepts like Row/Column order with mnemonics instead of explaining the reasoning
- Favor abstract examples (2d vectors! 3d vectors!) and avoid real-world topics until the final week

The survivors are physicists, graphics programmers and other masochists. We missed the key insight:

**Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.**

We can take a table of data (a matrix) and create updated tables from the original. It’s the power of a spreadsheet written as an equation.

Here’s the linear algebra introduction I wish I had, with a real-world stock market example.

## What’s in a name?

“Algebra” means, roughly, “relationships”. Grade-school algebra explores the relationship between unknown numbers. Without knowing x and y, we can still work out that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.

“Linear Algebra” means, roughly, “line-like relationships”. Let’s clarify a bit.

Straight lines are predictable. Imagine a rooftop: move forward 3 horizontal feet (relative to the ground) and you might rise 1 foot in elevation (The slope! Rise/run = 1/3). Move forward 6 feet, and you’d expect a rise of 2 feet. Contrast this with climbing a dome: each horizontal foot forward raises you a different amount.

Lines are nice and predictable:

- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, then going 10x as far should give a 10x rise (30 feet forward is a 10-foot rise)
- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, and 6 feet has a 2-foot rise, then (3 + 6) feet should have a (1 + 2) foot rise

In math terms, an operation F is linear if scaling inputs scales the output, and adding inputs adds the outputs:

In our example, $F(x)$ calculates the rise when moving forward x feet, and the properties hold:

## Linear Operations

An operation is a calculation based on some inputs. Which operations are linear and predictable? Multiplication, it seems.

Exponents ($F(x) = x^2$) aren’t predictable: $10^2$ is 100, but $20^2$ is 400. We doubled the input but quadrupled the output.

Surprisingly, regular addition isn’t linear either. Consider the “add three” function $F(x) = x + 3$:

We doubled the input and did not double the output. (Yes, $F(x) = x + 3$ happens to be the equation for an _offset_ line, but it’s still not “linear” because $F(10) \\neq 10 \\cdot F(1)$. Fun.)

So, what types of functions are _actually_ linear? Plain-old scaling by a constant, or functions that look like: $F(x) = ax$. In our roof example, $a = 1/3$.

But life isn’t _too_ boring. We can still combine multiple linear functions ($A(x) = ax, B(x) = bx, C(x)=cx$) into a larger one, $G$:

$G$ is still linear, since doubling the input continues to double the output:

We have “mini arithmetic”: multiply inputs by a constant, and add the results. It’s actually usefu... [Content truncated for context window]
