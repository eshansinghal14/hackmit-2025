## Linear Algebra Definitions

Before we do anything interesting with machine learning or optimization, we’ll need to review some essential linear algebra concepts.

Suppose we have two vectors \\(u,v \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n \\times 1}\\). Their _outer product_ is defined as \\(u \\cdot v^T\\), which is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. The inner product of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is defined \\(u^Tv \\in \\mathbf{R}^{1 \\times 1}\\), a scalar.

Orthogonal vectors satisfy \\(v^Tu = 0\\). For all \\(x \\neq 0\\), if the quadratic form is positive \\(x^TAx > 0\\), then the matrix is symmetric positive matrix; if instead \\(x^TAx \\geq 0\\), the matrix is symmetric positive semi-definite.

A vector norm assigns a scalar value to vector or matrix. It turns out that all norms are _equivalent_, meaning we can bound a certain norm above and below

\\\[\\delta \\\|x\\\|\_0 \\leq \\\|x\\\|\_{\\square} \\leq \\gamma \\\|x\\\|\_0\\\]

e.g. \\(\\\|x\\\|\_{\\alpha} \\leq C\_{\\alpha \\beta} \\\| x \\\|\_{\\beta}\\), or \\(\\\|x\\\|\_2 \\leq \\\|x\\\|\_1 \\leq \\sqrt{n} \\\|x\\\|\_2\\).

Many matrix norms are _induced_ from vector norms.

### Matrix Rank

### Vector Space

### Null Space of a Matrix

Given \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\), the **null space** of \\(A\\) is the set of vectors which are sent to the zero vector:

\\\[\\mathcal{N}(A) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid Ax = 0 \\}\\\]

Multiplication by \\(A\\) can be seen as a function which sends a vector \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) to a vector \\(Ax \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\).

Of course, \\(\\mathcal{N}(A)\\) always contains the zero vector, i.e. \\({0} \\in \\mathcal{N}(A)\\). But the question is, does it contain any other vectors? If the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent, then we can always say \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) = {0} \\).

### Column Space (Range) of a Matrix

Given an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we would like to know for which vectors \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) the system \\(Ax = b\\) has a solution. Let’s define the columns of \\(A\\) as:

\\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix} \| & \| & & \| \\\ v\_1 & v\_2 & \\cdots & v\_n \\\ \| & \| & & \| \... [Content truncated for context window]

**Content:**
# Preface

This linear algebra textbook was originally designed to be presented as twenty five, fifty minute lectures
suitable for sophomores likely to use the material for applications but still requiring
a solid foundation in this fundamental branch of mathematics. The main idea of the course is
to emphasize the concepts of vector spaces and linear transformations as mathematical
structures that can be used to model the world around us. Once \`\`persuaded'' of this truth, students
learn explicit skills such as Gaussian elimination and diagonalization in order that vectors and linear transformations
become calculational tools, rather than abstract mathematics.

In practical terms, the course aims to produce students who can perform computations with large linear systems
while at the same time understand the concepts behind these techniques. Often-times when a problem can be
reduced to one of linear algebra it is \`\`solved''. These notes
do not devote much space to applications (there are already a plethora of textbooks with titles involving some
permutation of the words \`\`linear'', \`\`algebra'' and \`\`applications''). Instead, they attempt to explain the fundamental
concepts carefully enough that students will realize for their own selves when the particular application they encounter
in future studies is ripe for a solution via linear algebra.

The notes are designed to be used in conjunction with a set of online homework exercises which help the students read the
lecture notes and learn
basic linear algebra skills. Interspersed among the lecture notes are links to simple online problems that
test whether students are actively reading the notes. In addition there are two sets of sample midterm problems with solutions as well
as a sample final exam.
There are also a set of ten online assignments which are collected weekly.
The first assignment is designed to ensure familiarity with some basic mathematic notions (sets, functions, logical quantifiers and basic methods of proof). The remaining nine assignments are devoted to the usual matrix and vector gymnastics expected from
any sophomore linear algebra class. These exercises are all available [here.](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/homework.html)
Webwork is an open source, online homework system which originated at the University of Rochester. It can efficiently check whether a student
has answered an explicit, typically computation-based, problem correctly. The problem sets chosen to accompany these
notes could contribute roughly 20% of a student's grade, and ensure that basic computational skills are mastered.
Most students rapidly realize that it is best to print out the Webwork assignments and solve them on paper before
entering the answers online. Those who do not tend to fare poorly on midterm examinations. We have found that there
tend to be relatively few questions from students in office hours about the Webwork assignments. Instead, by assigning 20%
of the grade to written assignments... [Content truncated for context window]

Many difficult science problems can handled using the powerful, yet easy to use, mathematics of linear algebra. Unfortunately, because the subject (at least for those learning it) requires seemingly arcane and tedious computations involving large arrays of number known as matrices, the key concepts and the wide applicability of linear algebra are easily missed. Therefore, before we equip you with matrix skills, let us give some hints about what linear algebra is. The takeaway message is

> ﻿Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations.

﻿In broad terms, vectors are things you can add and linear transformations are very special functions of vectors that respect vector addition. To understand this a little better, lets try some examples. Please be prepared to change the way you think about some familiar mathematical objects and keep a pencil and piece of paper handy!

In linear algebra, functions will again be focus of your attention, but now functions of a very special type.

Imagine you’re a builder, tasked with constructing a sturdy bridge across a river. You need to plot straight lines and calculate angles to ensure the bridge stands tall and strong.

This is where linear algebra steps in! It offers you a toolbox filled with matrices and vectors to map out your design in a mathematical space.

**Linear algebra is a type of math that solves straight-line problems. It uses grids of numbers called matrices to show these problems in vector space. Basically, it’s about how straight lines and vectors work in math.**

Linear algebra is really important in fields like engineering and physics. It helps us figure out various natural phenomena.

The main things we look at in linear algebra are straight-line problems, matrices, and spaces. Understanding these ideas is key to getting the basics of this subject.In this article, we will cover:

Linear algebra covers three main areas: linear equations, matrices, and vectors. The areas are interconnected and understanding them is crucial for mastering linear algebra. Let’s break down the topics within each category:

### **Linear Equations**

A linear equation is a foundational concept of linear algebra. It’s a mathematical expression written in a standard form, like a1x1 + a2x2 + … + anxn. In Linear equations, you work with variables.
