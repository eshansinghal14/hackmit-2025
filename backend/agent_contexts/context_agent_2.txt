## Your Mission as Agent 2:
1. Analyze ONLY the research sources assigned to you above
2. Extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from YOUR assigned sources
3. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology
4. Base nodes strictly on the content provided in your sources
5. Focus on the most important and well-supported concepts
6. Ensure nodes are specific and actionable
7. Include both foundational and advanced concepts if present

## Agent Coordination:
- You are Agent 2 of 5 total agents
- Each agent analyzes different sources to avoid duplication
- Your findings will be combined with other agents' results
- Focus on quality over quantity from your assigned sources

## Output Format:
Generate your knowledge nodes in this exact format:

**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. [Node Name]
2. [Node Name]
3. [Node Name]
4. [Node Name]
5. [Node Name]

**Source Summary:**
- Sources Analyzed: 2
- Agent Coverage: 2 of 8 total sources

Generate your specialized knowledge nodes now based strictly on your assigned research sources above.
