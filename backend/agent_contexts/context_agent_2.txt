About this Course

Kickstart your Python learning and get started with data science at the same time with this beginner-friendly, self-paced course. No prior programming skills are required. Python is the standard programming language used by data scientists and the demand for skilled individuals who can apply their Python knowledge to data science has never been higher.

You will learn basic programming concepts using Python such as native data types; data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries; programming logic including conditions, branching, and loops; and the gears that make up the engine of your application: functions and classes, those chunks of executable, reusable code that control the behavior of your application.

You will use a variety of Python libraries commonly used in data science such as Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup. You‚Äôll also automate data collection with Python using a technique called web scraping and application programming interfaces, or APIs. This course uses Jupyter Notebooks for your hands-on labs, another popular data science tool. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and automating tasks using Python by producing several artifacts for your portfolio to prove it.

# What You'll Learn

- Combine fundamental programming concepts such as data types, data structures, expressions, and variables to write Python code that executes simple tasks
- Write Python code using programming logic including branching, loops, functions, objects, and classes
- Construct data science models using Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup

**Notice:** While JavaScript is not essential for this website, your interaction with the content will be limited. Please turn JavaScript on for the full experience.

Welcome! Are you [completely new to programming](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)?
If _not_ then we presume you will be looking for information about
why and how to get started with Python.
Fortunately an
experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be)
can pick up Python very quickly.
It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so
[jump in](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)!

# Installing

Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays
many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python.
Even
some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python
already installed.
If you _do_ need to install Python and aren't confident about the
task you can find
a few notes on the
[BeginnersGuide/Download](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

# Learning

Before getting started, you may want to find out which [IDEs](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) and [text\
editors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) are tailored to make
Python editing easy, browse the list of [introductory books](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks), or look at [code samples](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples) that you might find
helpful.

There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the
[BeginnersGuide/Tutorials](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
page. There is also a list of
[resources in other languages](https://www.python.org/doc/nonenglish/)
which might be useful if English is not your first language.

The [online documentation](http://docs.python.org)
is your first port of call for definitive information.
There is a fairly brief
[tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
that gives you basic information about the language and
gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the
[library reference](http://docs.python.org/3/library/)
for a full description of Python's many libraries and the
[language reference](http://docs.python.org/3/reference/) for
a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax.
If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you
can browse the [ActiveState Python Cookbook](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/)

# Looking for Something Specific?

If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library
with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a
number of possible sources of information. The Python web site
provides a
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=index)
(also known as the _Cheese Shop_, a reference to the Monty Python
script of that name).
There is also a
[search page](https://www.python.org/search) for a num... [Content truncated for context window]

## Enhance your resume by adding Python to your programming skills.

Enhance your r√É¬©sum√É¬© by adding Python to your programming skills! The Python programming language was developed to provide a way to develop code that's easy to create and understand. While Python contains the same basic structures as other languages, it also offers unique functionality that makes your life as a programmer easier.

This course will show you how to create basic programming structures including decisions and loops. Then you'll move on to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming with classes and exceptions. In addition, you'll explore unique Python data structures such as tuples and dictionaries. You'll even learn how to create Python programs with graphic elements that range from simple circles and squares to graphical user interface (GUI) objects like buttons and labels.

Whether you're interested in writing simple scripts, full programs, or graphical user interfaces, this course will give you the tools you need to use Python with skill and confidence.

Courses are delivered to you through expertly executed lessons, online instruction and interaction with like-minded students. Our courses are designed to deliver all of the benefits of studying in a classroom whilst giving you the flexibility to study at a time and place to suit your needs. You can access your classroom 24/7 from any device with an internet connection.

This course has a 3 month duration. You'll complete comprehensive lessons, quizzes and assignments before submitting your final exam at the end of the course to achieve your certificate. Courses must be completed within the 3 month access period.

## \#\# Course Modules

## Lesson 1- Welcome to Python!

Two things that make Python attractive are that it's a free download and that it comes with a free development environment, IDLE. In our first lesson, we'll start off right by going on a brief tour of both the language and the environment. You'll see that with IDLE, you can either execute individual statements directly at the interpreter's prompt or save your commands in a program file to be run later. By the end of Lesson 1, you'll be fully prepared to work in IDLE using either method.

## Lesson 2- Get Interactive With Variables and User Input

Programs aren't terribly useful unless you have some way to store values in memory. In Lesson 2, you'll get up to speed with Python variables, and then you'll learn how to use these variables to get input from the user. With this, you'll be able to write Python code to make your programs interactive, making them more useful and a lot more interesting.
