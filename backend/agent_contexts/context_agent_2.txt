We describe the vision of being able to reason about the design space of data structures.

We break this down into two questions: 1) Can we know all data structures that is possible to design?  2) Can we compute the performance of arbitrary designs on a given hardware and workload without having to implement the design or even access the target hardware?

If those challenges are possible, then an array of exciting opportunities would become feasible such as interactive what-if design to improve the productivity of data systems researchers and engineers, and informed decision making in industrial settings with regards to critical ardware/workload/data structure design issues. Then, even fully automated discovery of new data structure designs becomes possible. Furthermore, the structure of the design space itself provides numerous insights and opportunities such as the existence of design continuums that can lead to data systems with deep adaptivity, and a new understanding of the possible performance trade-offs. Given the universal presence of data structures at the very core of any data-driven field across all sciences and industries, reasoning about their design can have significant benefits, making it more feasible (easier, faster and cheaper) to adopt tailored state-of-the-art storage solutions. And this effect is going to become increasingly more critical as data keeps growing, hardware keeps changing and more applications/fields realize the transformative power and potential of data analytics.

This paper presents this vision and surveys first steps that demonstrate its feasibility.

Let us learn about data structures and the best use cases. First off, what is a data structure? Data structures are how we organize, store, and retrieve data. Knowing when and how to appropriately use each data structure is important for ensuring your code efficiently uses time and space. Other things to consider: some data structures may run quicker, but take up more space, while others may take up less space, but run a little slower. You must always consider the trade offs of each use case and decide which is more beneficial for the company/code base.

That being said, let’s jump into the different kind of data structures and what they are most commonly used for.

# Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are single leveled data structures, for which each element is connected to the previous and next element. Linear data structures include: arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

## Array

Arrays have a grid like structure. The elements of an array are stored next to each other in memory. When using an array, all of the elements must be of the same data type (i.e. integers, strings, or booleans etc.). When creating an array, you want to define the size of the array, so that this space in memory may be reserved. This can be a negative aspect of arrays because, you can be left reserving unused space in memory, a... [Content truncated for context window]

REVIEWED BY

[Sara A. Metwalli](https://builtin.com/authors/sara-metwalli)

There are several basic and [advanced data structures](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures); they’re created to arrange [data](https://builtin.com/data-science) to make it useful for a specific purpose. At their core, data structures are intended to frame information in a way that makes that information clear and easily accessible to [both humans and machines](https://builtin.com/learn/tech-dictionary/relational-database).

## What Is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a format for organizing, storing, processing and retrieving data in a computer system. Data structures define how data is handled and accessed, making them fundamental to efficient programming and software applications.

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data: What’s the Difference?

[Structured and unstructured data](https://builtin.com/big-data) differ in many ways, however, the primary difference is that [structured data](https://builtin.com/articles/structured-data-testing-tool) is defined and searchable while unstructured data is contained in its native form. There is vastly more unstructured data in existence, which [makes up 80 percent of all enterprise data](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data-key-differences/). This percentage continues to grow, which presents opportunities for forward-thinking businesses to [mine data](https://builtin.com/learn/tech-dictionary/data-mining) insights.

Other differences include:

- Structured data is quantitative, while [unstructured data is qualitative](https://builtin.com/design-ux/prioritize-quantitative-qualitative-data).
- Structured data is stored in [data warehouses](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-warehousing), while unstructured data is contained in [data lakes](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse).
- Structured data can be immediately [analyzed](https://builtin.com/data-science/types-of-data-analysis), while unstructured data requires processing and transformation.
- Structured data follows predefined formats, while unstructured data comes in many different formats.

# Data Structure Introduction

## Data Structure Tutorials

Fundamental ConceptsData StructuresSorting AlgorithmsSearching TechniquesAlgorithms

Data structures are fundamental to computer science that help efficiently organize, manage, and store data. They enable developers to perform operations on data in a way that maximizes performance and minimizes resource usage. Understanding data structures is critical for solving complex problems and designing efficient algorithms.

## Understanding Data Fundamentals

In today's world, data plays a vital role in various aspects of life. It is basically a collection of facts and figures representing certain values organized in a specific format. These values can be further categorized into sub-items for more detailed information or grouped for a better understanding.

Let's consider a simple example to understand complex data structures. A student's information can be divided into sub-items such as first, middle, and last names. On the other hand, the ID assigned to a student represents a single data item. This difference between primary data items like ID, age, and gender and grouped data items like name and address is the first step toward understanding complex data structures. Understanding this difference helps you to discover how data structures organize, manage, and utilize data effectively.

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of arranging data on a computer to be accessed and modified efficiently. Depending on the requirement, data can be organized in various structures, each with its unique way of storing and accessing information. The choice of data structure affects the efficiency of an algorithm or a program, making understanding different types of data structures crucial for optimal programming practices.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of data structures is to organize data in a manner that suits the application's needs and enables efficient processing. For example, some data structures are designed for fast data retrieval, while others are optimized for quick modification. This differentiation highlights the importance of choosing the proper data structure for specific programming tasks.

## Classification of Data Structures

Data structures are broadly classified into two types:

- **Linear Data Structures**: Arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists to organize data sequentially.
- **Non-linear Data Structures**: Trees and graphs organize data hierarchically or interconnectedly, allowing for complex relationships between data elements.

In subsequent tutorials, you will learn more about Linear and Non-linear Data Structures, emphasizing their applications and efficiency in solving real-world problems.

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing data structures effectively is vital for developing efficient software. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance and scalability of applications. By mastering the basics of data s... [Content truncated for context window]

## What is a data structure?

Data structure refers to the way data is organized, stored, and manipulated in a computer system. It provides a means to efficiently manage and access data, enabling faster and more effective computations. By using different data structures, programmers can optimize their code and improve the performance of their applications.

## Why are data structures important in programming?

Data structures are crucial in programming as they allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data. They provide a framework for organizing and managing information, making it easier to perform operations on the data. By selecting the appropriate data structure for a specific task, you can optimize your code and improve overall performance.

## What are the different types of data structures?

There are various types of data structures, each designed for specific purposes. Some commonly used data structures include:

- **Arrays:** A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists:** A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one.
- **Stacks:** A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top.
- **Queues:** A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- **Trees:** A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes.
- **Graphs:** A collection of nodes interconnected by edges.
- **Hash Tables:** A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

# Cheat Sheets

# Every Data Structure on 1 Page

Lesson

### [Array](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#array)

An Array is an ordered list of elements, where each lives at an index 0, 1, 2, and so on. Arrays are also called "lists" in Python.

Read/Write Time **O(1)**.

Insert/Delete Time **O(n)**.

### [Stack](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#stack)

A Stack is an Array, but where you only Insert/Delete the last element. This makes inserting and deleting fast.

Read/Write Time **O(1)**.

Append/Pop Time **O(1)**.

### [HashMap](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#hashmap)

A HashMap is a generalized type of Array, where you can look up data using "keys". Keys can be anything as long as they're immutable: strings, tuples, numbers, letters, etc.

HashMaps are called "dictionaries" or "dicts" in Python.
We talk about how to implement a HashMap from scratch [here](https://deriveit.org/coding/making-the-hashmap-204).

Read/Write Time **O(1)**.

Insert/Delete Time **O(1)**.

### [Set](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#set)

A Set is a HashMap, but where all the values are True. You can quickly check if an element is/isn't in a Set. In Python, sets are implemented as their own data structure, and not as HashMaps.

Read/Write Time **O(1)**.

Insert/Delete Time **O(1)**.

### [Linked List](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#linked-list)

A Linked List is a custom data structure that you implement yourself. The first node in the Linked List is called the "head". Each node has a value `val`, and points to the next node `next`.

We used HashMaps here instead of ListNodes, because HashMaps are perfectly equivalent to objects and don't require boilerplate code to use. If this is confusing to you, see the [Classes and Objects](https://deriveit.org/coding/classes-and-objects-173) cheat sheet.

Read/Write Time **O(n)**.

Insert/Delete Time **O(n)**.

### [Tree](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#tree)

A Tree is a custom data structure you implement yourself.
Typically when you say "Tree", you're really referring to the root node of a Binary Tree. In a Binary Tree, each node has a value `val`, a left child `left`, and a right child `right`.

Here's how you create the above binary tree:

We used HashMaps here instead of TreeNodes, because HashMaps are perfectly equivalent to objects and don't require boilerplate code to use. If this is confusing to you, see the [Classes and Objects](https://deriveit.org/coding/classes-and-objects-173) cheat sheet.

Trees generally have a height of O(n), but balanced trees are spread wider and have a height of O(log n), which makes reading/writing faster.

Read/Write Time Varies.

Insert/Delete Time Varies; **O(log n)** for balanced trees like Binary Search Trees and Heaps.

### [Graph](https://deriveit.org/deriveit.org\#graph)

A graph is made of nodes that point to each other.

There are two general ways you can store a graph, and both are common in coding interviews:

You might also see a graph just stored as a single array... [Content truncated for context window]

## Your Mission as Agent 2:
1. Analyze ONLY the research sources assigned to you above
2. Extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from YOUR assigned sources
3. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology
4. Base nodes strictly on the content provided in your sources
5. Focus on the most important and well-supported concepts
6. Ensure nodes are specific and actionable
7. Include both foundational and advanced concepts if present

## Agent Coordination:
- You are Agent 2 of 5 total agents
- Each agent analyzes different sources to avoid duplication
- Your findings will be combined with other agents' results
- Focus on quality over quantity from your assigned sources
