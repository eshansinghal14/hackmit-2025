## Potatoes: A Nutrient-Dense Vegetable

## Unpacking the health benefits of America's favorite vegetable

## Whole Food, Affordable Nutrition

For 110 calories, one medium-sized (5.3 ounce), skin-on [potato delivers essential vitamins and minerals](https://potatogoodness.com/nutrition/), 3 grams of plant-based protein, and no fat, sodium, or cholesterol. Potatoes are a delicious vegetable people love and a nutritious solution that makes sense for the body and budget. In fact, this filling vegetable has one of the highest scores per dollar on eight important nutrients: potassium, [ﬁber](https://potatogoodness.com/nutrition/), protein, vitamins C and E, calcium, iron, and magnesium. Moreover, research has shown that including potatoes in the diet can support higher vegetable intakes– a winning combination.

## Nutritional Powerhouse

Potatoes supply essential nutrients needed to conquer each day. You may be surprised to learn that potatoes also provide two nutrients of public health concern, including potassium and fiber. One medium-sized (5.3 ounce), skin-on potato delivers:

- Vitamin C: 27mg per serving, 30% DV
- Potassium: 620mg, 15% DV
- Vitamin B6: 0.2mg, 10% DV
- Carbohydrates: 26g, 9% DV
- Fiber: 2g, 7% DV
- Iron: 1.1mg, 6% DV
- Protein: 3g

## Enhancing Nutrient Intakes

Potatoes provide a great-tasting, affordable nutrient package that enables people to meet their goals for nutrient intake and vegetable consumption. Research shows that including potatoes as part of healthy diets can help people to meet nutrient intakes recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

A [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/8/2614/htm) using NHANES 2001-2018 data found that adolescents ages 9 to 18 years who consumed all forms of potatoes had better diet quality, nutrient intake and adequacy compared to those who did not consume potatoes.

A [study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/abs/potato-consumption-is-not-associated-with-elevated-cardiometabolic-risk-in-adolescent-girls/0260DA4195E01CDE44F5EACD0ED4296E) using data from the National Growth and Health Study demonstrated that higher intakes of potatoes in any form during early adolescence (a...

# The Nutritional Value of Potatoes

Last Updated : 01 March 2010

**Table of contents**

Potatoes are a very common food in the diets of most Europeans, but perhaps sometimes the nutrition contribution of this staple crop is overlooked. To start with, there are considerable nutritional differences between potato dishes depending on how they are cooked, and this may have an impact on how potatoes as a food are perceived by consumers. What makes potatoes special is that they combine the characteristics of starchy foods with those of vegetables.

First imported from South America in the 16th century, potatoes took another 150 years before actually becoming one of the most important staple food crops in Europe. Nowadays, Central and Eastern Europeans are the highest consumers, but potatoes play a role in diets all across the continent, with an average per capita consumption of 94 kg in 2005.1 Listed below are important and interesting nutritional aspects that are worth considering in the discussion on the contribution of potatoes towards a healthy balanced diet.2

When boiled or baked, potatoes are a virtually fat-free food. The main energy-providing nutrient in potatoes is carbohydrate, in the form of starch. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body, and should supply at least half of your calories for the day. The advantage of getting carbohydrates from potatoes is that you will be getting a considerable amount of certain micronutrients as well. Potatoes contain a small amount of protein: about 3 g in a boiled medium portion of 180 g (see Table 1). Although this is less than 10% of the daily adult requirement, potatoes are a good source of the amino acids lysine and tryptophan and combined with milk or eggs make for a high quality protein food.

Potatoes are a source of fibre, which contributes to the feeling of fullness, and supports healthy digestive functions. A 180 g portion of boiled potatoes provides about 3 grams of fibre, which equates to more than 10% of the daily recommended intake of fibre, namely 25 grams.3 Some people enjoy the stronger taste of eating cooked potatoes with skins on, and in this form they contain even more fibre. However care must be taken not to eat skins that are discoloured or marked. Green patches indicate higher levels of glycoalkaloids such as solanine, which may lead to ill health if consumed in large amounts. A small amount of the starch in potatoes resists digestion (this is called ‘resistant starch’): this particularly occurs when potatoes are eaten cold after being cooked, such as in a potato salad. Resistant starch acts in the body in a similar way to fibre, and may aid in the control of blood glucose and blood lipid levels.4

Potatoes are a steady reliable source of vitamin C – a medium boiled potato (180 g) contains about 10 mg, which is about one eighth of the adult req... [Content truncated for context window]

### Why It Works

- Large chunks of potato maximize the contrast between exterior and interior.
- Parboiling the potatoes in alkaline water breaks down their surfaces, creating tons of starchy slurry for added surface area and crunch.
- Offering you the choice of oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat means you can get whichever flavor you want.
- Infusing the oil or fat with garlic and herbs gives the potato crust extra flavor.

The Brits get a bad rap for their cuisine, and in some cases rightfully so—the beef cooked until gray and the gravy-made-from-granules that I ate every Sunday while staying in England were not the height of culinary greatness—but dang if there aren't a lot of things they do better than almost anyone else. I'm talking [savory pies](https://www.seriouseats.com/chicken-and-leek-pie-recipe), fried fish, [Yorkshire puddings](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-yorkshire-pudding-popover-recipe), and roasted potatoes. The British method of roasting potatoes is one that I've taken a strong liking to. It's simple, and it produces amazing results. Boil chunks of potato until they're just tender, toss them none-too-gently with fat (ideally beef drippings) to rough up their surface, then roast them until they're crisp and crackling.

Potatoes are herbaceous perennials in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), but they are grown as annual crops. Potatoes are native to South America in parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. They are now widely cultivated and major producers include China, Germany, India, Russia and the United States. The genus name, _Solanum_, is derived from the Latin word, _solamen,_ which means "comforting or soothing." The species name, _tuberosum_, means "tuber."

Potatoes grow best in full sun and well-drained, sandy and acidic soil. Poorly drained soil may cause tubers to rot, and acidic soil helps to prevent bacterial scabs. Light soil, if consiste... [Content truncated for context window]

# Potatoes: The Misunderstood Marvel of the Vegetable World
| |
| --- |
| _By: Judy Davie - The Food Coach_![](https://www.thefoodcoach.com.au/img/stock/nl_1_W6P45h.jpg)Potatoes often get a bad rap in the realm of healthy eating. But these humble tubers, with their rich history and undeniable versatility, deserve a closer look. Not only are they an economical staple in many households, but they also pack a nutritional punch that can be a valuable part of a balanced diet. Let's peel back the layers and explore the health benefits, economic advantages, portion control, and circumstances when potatoes might not be your best friend. **The Health Benefits of Potatoes** Potatoes are a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals. A medium-sized potato (about 150 grams) contains: **Vitamin C**: Boosts the immune system and acts as a powerful antioxidant. **Vitamin B6**: Essential for brain health and energy metabolism. **Potassium**: More than a banana, which helps regulate blood pressure. **Fibre:** Particularly in the skin, aiding in digestion and promoting gut health. These nutrients are vital for overall health, making potatoes a valuable addition to your diet. When prepared healthily, such as baked or boiled, potatoes can be a low-calorie, nutrient-dense food. **Economical and Accessible** One of the standout features of potatoes is their affordability. They are one of the most economical vegetables available, making them a crucial component of budget-friendly meal planning. A kilogram of potatoes can serve multiple meals, stretching your dollar while still providing essential nutrients. Additionally, potatoes have a long shelf life when stored correctly, reducing food waste and ensuring you always have a nutritious option on hand. Their versatility means they can be used in a variety of dishes, from soups and stews to salads and side dishes, making them a kitchen staple. **Portion Size: The Key to Healthy Eating** As with many foods, moderation is key when it comes to potatoes. Portion control can make all the difference in enjoying the health benefits without the downsides. A recommended serving size is about the size of a computer mouse or half a cup of cooked potatoes. This portion provides a good balance of carbohydrates for energy, fibre for digestion, and essential vitamins and minerals. Pairing potatoes with a variety of vegetables and a source of lean protein can create a well-rounded meal. For instance, a baked potato topped with steamed broccoli and a grilled chicken breast makes for a nutritious and satisfying dinner. **When Are Potatoes Not Good for You?** While potatoes have many health benefits, there are instances when they might not be the best choice: **Fried Potatoes:** French fries and chips are often loaded with unhealthy fats and sodium, which can negate the nutritional benefits of the potato itself. Toppings and Add-ons: Butter, sour cream, and cheese can add excessive calories and saturated fat. Opt for healthier toppings ... [Content truncated for context window]

# Potato

**Scientific Name(s):** Solanum tuberosum L. **Common Name(s):** Irish potato, Potato, US russet, White potato

[Medically reviewed](https://www.drugs.com/support/editorial_policy.html#editorial-staff) by Drugs.com. Last updated on Nov 21, 2024.

## Clinical Overview

### Use

Potatoes are rich in starch and several vitamins. They are also considered to be a source of high-quality and allergy-free protein. Studies have primarily been conducted in animals and/or in vitro; clinical trial data are lacking to recommend use for any indication.

### Dosing

Potato has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status when used as food. There is no clinical evidence to support specific dosing recommendations. The widespread use of the tubers as a food is tempered by the occurrence of toxic alkaloids in sprouting potatoes and in foliage.

### Contraindications

Contraindications have not been identified. Excessive consumption of potatoes in individuals with severe renal function impairment may lead to hyperkalemia.

### Pregnancy/Lactation

Potato has GRAS status when used as food. Avoid excessive consumption because safety and efficacy are unproven.

### Interactions

None well documented.

### Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions to raw and cooked potato have been documented and include anaphylaxis. GI symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) are generally associated with consumption of blighted, greening, or sprouted tubers. Potatoes may affect glycemic control and insulin levels in individuals with diabetes.

### Toxicology

The 2 primary types of toxins associated with potatoes are acrylamide and glycoalkaloids; levels depend on the cultivar as well as on postharvesting and processing methods. Symptoms associated with toxicity from potato consumption include weak, rapid pulse; rapid and shallow breathing; delirium; and coma. Reports of death exist, especially associated with consumption of blighted, greening, or sprouted tubers.

## Scientific Family

- Solanaceae (nightshade)

## Botany

The potato is a weedy plant recognized for its tuberous growth and valued as a commercial food. Potatoes are propagated from the underground runners of the plant from the "eyes."( [Mabberley 1987](https://www.drugs.com/www.drugs.com#Mabberley.1987), [USDA 2022](https://www.drugs.com/www.drugs.com#USDA.2022))

## History

Potatoes have been cultivated since 500 BC; Central and South American Indians were probably among the first to select hardy cultivators of the potato as a food staple.( [Friedman 2006](https://www.drugs.com/www.drugs.com#17090106), [Mabberley 1987](https://www.drugs.com/www.drugs.com#Mabberley.1987)) Despite the Spanish introduction of the plant into Europe in the late 1500s, the tubers did not become a popular food source until the 17th century because of religious and mythological concerns regarding toxicity of the plant.

# About food: potatoes

This is the second installment of a series on common food ingredients; the first was about [corn.](https://kartiniclinic.com) At Kartini Clinic we spend our lives restoring the health of our young patients. Their families look to us for advice (sensible advice) about food and eating, and this series is part of that.

To briefly recap, these little food blogs will have three sections:

- “Your Grandmother’s” – fast, easy but still largely homemade
- “A Cut Above” – for those who are really into being as healthy as possible, inconvenience be damned
- “Portlandia” –  for those of us (whether from Portland or not!) who are fanatic foodies and want only local and organic home cooking

I will include some citations at the end of each blog for those who wish to read further, or to challenge me (which I welcome; happens all the time).

Potatoes are featured on the Kartini meal plan as a suggested “starch” in a 6oz. serving size.  Some people always eat either (white) potatoes or (white) bread with their dinner and find anything else unacceptably “adventurous”.  Some people alternate them with sweet potatoes, quinoa, rice, tortillas, etc.  Serve what your family will eat.  My family is Irish-American and we grew up thinking of potatoes as the true staff of life.  They are also gluten free, so that would make them popular again because of the current interest in gluten-free eating.
