About this Course

Kickstart your Python learning and get started with data science at the same time with this beginner-friendly, self-paced course. No prior programming skills are required. Python is the standard programming language used by data scientists and the demand for skilled individuals who can apply their Python knowledge to data science has never been higher.

You will learn basic programming concepts using Python such as native data types; data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries; programming logic including conditions, branching, and loops; and the gears that make up the engine of your application: functions and classes, those chunks of executable, reusable code that control the behavior of your application.

You will use a variety of Python libraries commonly used in data science such as Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup. You‚Äôll also automate data collection with Python using a technique called web scraping and application programming interfaces, or APIs. This course uses Jupyter Notebooks for your hands-on labs, another popular data science tool. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and automating tasks using Python by producing several artifacts for your portfolio to prove it.

# What You'll Learn

- Combine fundamental programming concepts such as data types, data structures, expressions, and variables to write Python code that executes simple tasks
- Write Python code using programming logic including branching, loops, functions, objects, and classes
- Construct data science models using Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup
- Import web data into a Python application using APIs and web scraping

## Enhance your resume by adding Python to your programming skills.

Enhance your r√É¬©sum√É¬© by adding Python to your programming skills! The Python programming language was developed to provide a way to develop code that's easy to create and understand. While Python contains the same basic structures as other languages, it also offers unique functionality that makes your life as a programmer easier.

This course will show you how to create basic programming structures including decisions and loops. Then you'll move on to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming with classes and exceptions. In addition, you'll explore unique Python data structures such as tuples and dictionaries. You'll even learn how to create Python programs with graphic elements that range from simple circles and squares to graphical user interface (GUI) objects like buttons and labels.

Whether you're interested in writing simple scripts, full programs, or graphical user interfaces, this course will give you the tools you need to use Python with skill and confidence.

Courses are delivered to you through expertly executed lessons, online instruction and interaction with like-minded students. Our courses are designed to deliver all of the benefits of studying in a classroom whilst giving you the flexibility to study at a time and place to suit your needs. You can access your classroom 24/7 from any device with an internet connection.

This course has a 3 month duration. You'll complete comprehensive lessons, quizzes and assignments before submitting your final exam at the end of the course to achieve your certificate. Courses must be completed within the 3 month access period.

## \#\# Course Modules

## Lesson 1- Welcome to Python!

Two things that make Python attractive are that it's a free download and that it comes with a free development environment, IDLE. In our first lesson, we'll start off right by going on a brief tour of both the language and the environment. You'll see that with IDLE, you can either execute individual statements directly at the interpreter's prompt or save your commands in a program file to be run later. By the end of Lesson 1, you'll be fully prepared to work in IDLE using either method.

## Lesson 2- Get Interactive With Variables and User Input

Programs aren't terribly useful unless you have some way to store values in memory. In Lesson 2, you'll get up to speed with Python variables, and then you'll learn how to use these variables to get input from the user. With this, you'll be able to write Python code to make your programs interactive, making them more useful and a lot more interesting.

## Lesson 3- Decisions, Decisions

There are many times when you'll want one set of st... [Content truncated for context window]
