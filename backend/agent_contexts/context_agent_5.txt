### Source 37: What Are The Health Benefits Of Potatoes?

**Content:**
The humble spud. Why has it had such a bad wrap? People seem less scared of death than they are of eating a potato these days. If you come to my house on a Sunday you will be fed your own body weight in roast potatoes. Ultra crunchy and fluffy inside. Does it get much better?

Potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_) are one of the most widely consumed staple foods globally, providing a valuable source of carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins, and minerals. While often mischaracterised as unhealthy due to their carbohydrate content, potatoes are in fact highly nutritious and offer numerous health benefits. Different varieties, including white, red, yellow, and purple potatoes, contain unique bioactive compounds that contribute to overall health. This article provides a scientifically detailed examination of the health benefits of potatoes, including their nutritional value, digestive health benefits, immune support, metabolic effects, and potential roles in disease prevention.

Potatoes are particularly rich in potassium, which supports cardiovascular health, and vitamin C, which enhances immune function. Different potato varieties also contain unique phytochemicals, with purple and red potatoes being high in anthocyanins, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Lachman et al., 2013).

### Digestive Health and Prebiotic Benefits

Potatoes contain **both soluble and insoluble fibre**, which support digestive health. The **resistant starch** found in cooled, cooked potatoes functions as a **prebiotic**, feeding beneficial gut bacteria such as _Bifidobacteria_ and _Lactobacilli_ (Slavin, 2013). Resistant starch has been shown to improve **gut barrier integrity**, enhance **nutrient absorption**, and reduce **inflammation in the digestive tract** (Zaman & Sarbini, 2016).

Insoluble fibre in potatoes adds bulk to stool and **prevents constipation**, while soluble fibre **stabilises blood sugar levels**by slowing digestion (Eswaran et al., 2013). Studies suggest that resistant starch may also **reduce the risk of colorectal cancer** by promoting short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut (Topping & Clifton, 2001).

### Blood Sugar Regulation and Metabolic Health

Now this one IS a shocker. Despite being a carbohydrate-rich food, potatoes have a variable glycaemic index (GI) depending on their preparation. Boiled and cooled potatoes have a lower GI due to their resistant starch content, while fried or mashed potatoes tend to have a higher GI, leading to more rapid blood sugar spikes (Atkinson et al., 2008).

Resistant starch in potatoes enhances insulin sensitivity and may help regulate postprandial glucose levels, making them a beneficial food for individuals with type 2 diabetes (Johnston et al., 2010). Additionally, their high potassium and magnesium content contributes to insulin function and glucose metabolism (Rodriguez-Moran & Guerrero-Romero, 2003).

## There Are So Many Types of Potatoes!

You’ve probably heard that some potatoes are bakers, some are best in a potato salad, and others make really fantastic hash browns, but do you know which one is which?

There is so much to talk about. First, let me explain why I decided to write about potatoes. Then I'll give you a brief explanation of each type. I'll share a video that explains the science behind how potatoes "work" in the kitchen. Finally, we'll end with a recipe for each category of potato that perfectly showcases that potato's unique characteristics.

## Tell Me Something About Potatoes

I have a reputation ... my friends know me as the Carb Diva, and so I've become their default "go-to" person when they have questions about how to adjust a recipe, how to rescue a meal gone bad, or where to find an ingredient (or reasonable substitution). And then, there is the occasional challenge—just for fun, someone will toss out a random query to test my skills (or have a bit of fun at my expense). That happened a few weeks ago when this request showed up in my mailbox:

> "Give me a recipe and a historical fact about the regal potato that you haven't given us before. This should be a piece of cake for our Diva!"

I don't know if I would call the potato "regal," but it certainly has been around for a long, long time. The plant that eventually became the potato originated in the area between Peru and Bolivia, and scientists say that it has evolved over a period of 350 million years. Perhaps Venerable is a more apt title.

In the 1500s when the Spanish did their conquistador thing in the New World, they took samples of the potato home with them. It received less than glowing approval. Who could imagine a plant that is _poisonous_ (yes, poisonous—except for the underground roots) could be good to eat?

Peru's perfect potato plant was viewed by some as at least weird and by many as evil and responsible for almost every known ailment from leprosy and sterility to syphilis, sexual compulsion, and early death. (OK, so that last one was probably accurate if they ate more than the tubers).

You can thank a French botanist and chemist for recognizing the potato's true potential. He convinced Louis XVI, the King of France, that the plant was worth cultivating. Louis granted 100 acres of land to the scientist which were planted and t... [Content truncated for context window]

[Skip to main content](https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu#main-content)

# Growing Potatoes in the Home Garden

The potato ( _Solanum tuberosum_) is one of the most important vegetable crops in the world. The edible part of the potato plant is the underground swollen stem known as a tuber. The tubers of potato cultivars vary in size, shape, color, storability, and culinary uses.

Growing potatoes in the home garden can be a rewarding process.  (1)

The "Irish" potato is actually a native of South America.  It didn't become an important food crop in Ireland until it was introduced to the island in the sixteenth century.

## Planting

### Site Preparation

Potatoes prefer loose, well-drained, fertile, slightly acid soils. Don't apply large amounts of organic matter, such as manure, to the soil where potatoes will be grown. The addition of organic matter may increase the occurrence of potato scab.  The planting site should receive at least six hours of direct sun each day.

If a soil test has not been conducted, applying 1 to 2 pounds of all-purpose garden fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, per 100 square feet should be adequate for most home gardens. Broadcast and incorporate the fertilizer shortly before planting.

### Seed Potato Sources & Preparation

Large potatoes should be cut into sections or pieces, each containing 1 or 2 "eyes" or buds. Allow the cut ends to callus before planting.  (2)

Since potatoes are susceptible to several serious diseases, buy certified disease-free potatoes from a reliable garden center or nursery. Home-grown potatoes saved from the previous year's crop may carry undetectable diseases. Potatoes purchased at supermarkets may have been treated to prevent sprouting. The best results (excellent quality and high yields) are obtained with certified seed potatoes.

Large potatoes should be cut into sections or pieces, each containing 1 or 2 "eyes" or buds. Small potatoes may be planted whole. Seed piece decay may be a problem in cool, wet soils. This problem may be prevented by treating the cut seed pieces with a fungicide or storing them at 60 to 70°F and 85% relative humidity for several days. These storage conditions allow the cut surfaces of the seed pieces to heal or callus over before they are pl... [Content truncated for context window]

# Potato Factoids

Interesting facts and science behind the potato plant.

A simplified fact sheet on potatoes with an accompanying experiment for Primary school children can be downloaded below

[Primary Potato Science Experiment](https://dyvdnmp0itmzz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11170616/Primary-Potato-Science-Experiment.pdf)

• Botanically the potato plant is a dicotyledon in the family Solanaceae which includes the fruits tomatoes, sweet and hot peppers and aubergines which are all used as vegetables. The potato plant occasionally produces berries, the seeds of which (true seeds) are used in breeding. The tubers develop from underground stolons (shoots) by which they remain attached to the mother plant. Commercially propagation is achieved by seed potatoes, whole tubers, or parts of a tuber cut in pieces which must include at least one bud or eye.

• The modern potato is _Solanum tuberosum L._, of which two subspecies have become differentiated, ssp _andigena_ is the typical Andean form still grown in South America and spp _. Tuberosum_ which has been developed during the last few centuries in Europe.

![](https://dyvdnmp0itmzz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09124724/Image-1-min-1024x683.jpg)

• The genus Solanum apart from the potato includes tobacco and the deadly nightshade, _Atropa belladonna_ and other poisonous plants. Due to the presence of an alkaloid called solanin, the fruit and leaves are poisonous and should not be consumed. There are a number of different alkaloids produced, as a result of secondary metabolism and is a natural defence mechanism of the plant against hungry pests.

• Greening of the skin of tubers and underlying flesh results from the exposure to light which may have occurred either in the field if tubers project above the soil or after harvest especially if washed tubers are displayed in brightly lit shops. There is a difference in the pattern of greening depending on where the exposure took place. Pre-harvest greening manifests itself as intense greening on the part of the tuber exposed to sunlight for several weeks whereas post-harvest greening (sometimes called ‘lightburn’) tends to be more diffuse, often affecting the entire tuber surface. The greening is due to the plant pigment is chlorophyll found naturally in all green plants and essential for photosynthesis to occur. Chlorophyll is tasteless and non-toxic but solanin...

Potatoes are the 3rd most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat and the leading vegetable crop in the United States. For many, potatoes are a staple in the kitchen because of their versatility and low cost. Potatoes provide important essential nutrients, including 45 percent of the Daily Value of vitamin C, as well as potassium and dietary fiber, two nutrients that are often lacking in the American diet.

**Selecting Potatoes:**

- Look for potatoes that are firm, and fairly clean.
- Avoid those with wrinkled or wilted skins, soft dark spots, discoloration, cut or bruised surfaces or greening.

**Storing Potatoes:**

- Store in a cool (between 45°F to 55°F), and dark space with good ventilation. Do not refrigerate or freeze potatoes.
- Store potatoes away from other vegetables as they can absorb other flavors.
- Do NOT wash potatoes until you are ready to prepare them.

**Preparing Potatoes:**

- Scrub potatoes under cold running water with a clean vegetable brush.
- Peel potatoes, dice or cut into desired sizes. Sometimes potatoes that are cut and uncooked take on a pinkish or brownish color. Potatoes that become discolored are safe to eat and do not need to be thrown out. The color usually disappears with cooking.
- To preserve the color of cut potatoes, immediately place in cold water. A mixture of 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar and 1 gallon of water can also be used. Limit water soaking to two hours to retain water-soluble vitamins.

**Green or Spouting Potatoes:**

- Potatoes that turn completely green should not be used but small spots can be trimmed away. This is caused by too much exposure to natural or fluorescent lighting.
- Cut any sprouts away before cooking or eating potatoes. Sprouts are a sign that the potato is trying to grow. Storing potatoes in a cool, dry, dark location will reduce sprouting.

# Lowering Potassium in Potatoes

**Written by DaVita® renal dietitian, Sara Colman, RD, CSR, CDE**

Certain high-potassium foods, such as potatoes, can be soaked in water to reduce their [potassium](https://www.davita.com/diet-nutrition/articles/basics/potassium-and-chronic-kidney-disease) content for people on the [kidney diet](https://www.davita.com/diet-nutrition). For years, renal dietitians have instructed patients on low-potassium diets to cut up and leach or soak potatoes to reduce the potassium load. That’s because one small potato (1-3/4 inches to 2-1/4 inches in diameter) contains more than 700 milligrams of potassium. And one average-sized, whole, baked potato (2-1/3"x 4-3/4" or about 1-1/3 cups, if measured) contains 926 milligrams of potassium with the skin or 610 milligrams of potassium without the skin. If you are on a low-potassium diet, this is a considerable amount for one serving.

**What’s the best way to reduce potassium in potatoes?**

For the most effective potassium removal, potatoes must be cut into small pieces, sliced thin or grated. If boiled at least 10 minutes in a large pot of water, potassium is reduced by at least half the original amount. These potatoes will still contain 100 to 200 milligrams of potassium in a 1/2-cup serving so people on a low-potassium diet are encouraged to pay attention to portion control.

If boiling isn’t the planned cooking method, potassium may still be reduced by slicing or cutting potatoes into small pieces or grating them and soaking them in a large amount of water at room temperature or warmer for greater potassium removal.

The least effective method of removing potassium is to soak potatoes in the refrigerator, then prepare without boiling first.

**What about other forms of potatoes?**

Canned potatoes go through a natural leaching process due to soaking in the canned water. A 1/2-cup serving of drained canned potatoes that is one inch in diameter contains 206 milligrams of potassium.

Instant potatoes are highly processed and lose some potassium during processing. A 1/2-cup serving of prepared potato granules or flakes contains 150 to 220 milligrams of potassium.

Hash browns, either frozen or home prepared, contain 340 to 450 milligrams of potassium in a 1/2-cup portion. Grated potatoes that are soaked or boiled according to the researchers’ methods and then fried contain between 100 to 150 milligrams of potassium in a 1/2-cup portion.

A comparison of 16 different varieties and brands of potato chips reveals a range of 265 to 495 milligrams of potassium for one cup of chips or a one-ounce bag.

A small order of French fries from five major fast food chains ranges from 470 to 510 milligrams of potassium. That’s about 20 milligrams f... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 45: POTATO History

**Content:**
### Where did the Potato come from?

A high plateau in the Andean Mountains of South America is the birthplace of the 'Irish' white potato that we eat today. The plateau, known today as the Titicaca Plateau, stretches across part of the countries of Peru and Bolivia. The Aymara Indians developed more than two hundred varieties of the potato at elevations greater than 10,000 feet. Potatoes formed the basis of the Aymara Indian and Incan diet.

Potatoes also were an important influence on Incan culture.

Potato-shaped pottery is commonly found at excavated sites. Incan units of time correlated to the length of time it took for a potato to cook to various consistencies. Potatoes were even used to predict weather.

### When did the potato become a staple food crop?

The potato quickly took the place of other crops as a food staple because it was a more reliable crop than wheat, which suffered as a food crop when the damp climates of Europe prevented proper ripening. Potatoes furthered both an agrarian revolution already underway in the early 17th century and a population increase in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, more and more farmers were drawn from subsistence farming into profit-driven economies. The agrarian revolution, stimulated by the potato, was integral to the Industrial Revolution.

European immigrants introduced potatoes to North America several times throughout the 1600s, but they were not widely grown for almost a century. Not until 1719, when Irish immigrants brought the potato to Londonderry, New Hampshire, were potatoes grown on a large scale. Again, potatoes were slow to gain popularity. Even when they became the second largest food crop in America, they were still used primarily as animal fodder.

### What was the Irish potato famine?

Ironically, the dependable potato was responsible for one of the most horrifying famines of the last 200 years. Introduced into Ireland in the mid-1700s, the potato proved to be an ideal crop for its environment. Ireland gets an average of 60 inches of precipitation each year, in general too much for potatoes. However, the precipitation is mostly in the form of soft misty showers, which keep the air cool and the soil moist.

By the 1800s, Irish peasants were eating a daily average of 10 potatoes per person. Potatoes supplied about 80 percent of the calories in their diet. The peasants used potato fodder to feed their animals, animals which provided milk, meat and eggs to supplement the peasants' diet. This dependence on one food crop was dangerous, but no other crop had ever proved to be as reliable.

In the 1840s, disaster struck. Three successive years of late blight, the microscopic fungus Phytophthora infestans, and heavy rains rotted the potato crops in the ground. Without potatoes, both the peasants and animals went hungry. And when the animals died for lack of food, milk, meat and eggs were no longer available. More than one million of Ireland's 8 million inhabitants died o... [Content truncated for context window]
