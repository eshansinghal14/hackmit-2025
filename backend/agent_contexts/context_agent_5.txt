## Introduction to Python

Python is a simple but powerful scripting language. It was developed
by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands in the late 1980s. The language
takes its name from the British comedy series _Monty Python's Flying_
_Circus_. Python is an interpreted language unlike C or Fortran that
are compiled languages.

### Monty Python and the Fish Slapping Dance

### Monty Python and the Cheese Shop

### Monty Python and the Dead Parrot

### Why Python?

- Clean syntax that is concise. You can say a lot more with fewer
 words.
- Design is compact. You can carry all the language constructs in
 your head.
- [Powerful library of\
 useful functions.](http://www.python.org/about/)

This means that you can be productive quite easily and fast. You will
be spending more time solving problems and writing code than grappling
with the idiosyncrasies of the language.

### Your First Program

You can use Python interactively. When you start Python in the interactive
mode you will see the following prompt _>>>_. Your first
interaction and response will be as follows:

```
>>> print "Hello World!"
Hello World!

```

For longer programs you can store your program in a file that ends with
a _.py_ extension. Save your first program in a file called
_Hello.py_. It will have a single statement - _print "Hello World!"_. To run your program, type at the command line

```
> python Hello.py

```

You can also create a stand alone script. On a Unix / Linux machine you
can create a script called _Hello.py_. This script will contain the
following lines of code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python
print "Hello World!"

```

Before you run it, you must make it into an executable file.

```
> chmod +x Hello.py

```

To run the script, you simply call it by name like so:

```
> ./Hello.py

```

### First Program in Java

```
public class Hello
{
 public static void main (String[] args)
 {
 System.out.println ("Hello World!");
 }
}

```

To compile and run the program you do:

```
javac Hello.java

java Hello

```

### Structure of a Computer Language

- Character set
- Variables
- Types
- Operators
- Assignments
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Input / Output

### Basic Syntax of Python

#### Character Set in Python

Python uses the traditional ASCII character set. The latest version
(2.7) also recognizes the Unicode character set. The ASCII character
set is a subset of the Unicode character set.

#### Identifiers

Python is case sensitive. These are rules for creating an indentifier:

- Must start with a letter or underscore (\_)
- Can be followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
- Cannot be a reserved word.

#### Variables

A variable in Python denotes a memory location. In that memory location
is the address of where the actual value is stored in memory. Consider
this assignment:

```

x = 1

```

A memory location is set aside for the variable _x_. The value
_1_ is stored in another place in memory. The address of the location
where _1_ is store... [Content truncated for context window]

# Getting started

Computer programs consist of _commands_, each command instructing the computer to take some action. A computer executes these commands one by one. Among other things, commands can be used to perform calculations, compare things in the computer's memory, cause changes in how the program functions, relay messages or ask for information from the program's user.

Let's begin programming by getting familiar with the `print` command, which _prints_ text. In this context, printing essentially means that the program will show some text on the screen.

The following program will print the line "Hi there!":

```
print("Hi there!")
```

When the program is run, it produces this:

Sample output

Hi there!

The program will not work unless the code is written exactly as it is above. For example, trying to run the print command without the quotation marks, like so

```
print(Hi there!)
```

will not print out the message, but instead causes an error:

Sample output

```
File "", line 1
 print(Hi there!)
 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

In summary, if you want to print text, the text must all be encased in quotation marks or Python will not interpret it correctly.

## A program of multiple commands

Multiple commands written in succession will be executed in order from first to last.
For example this program

```
print("Welcome to Introduction to Programming!")
print("First we will practice using the print command.")
print("This program prints three lines of text on the screen.")
```

prints the following lines on the screen:

Sample output

Welcome to Introduction to Programming!
First we will practice using the print command.
This program prints three lines of text on the screen.

## Arithmetic operations

You can also put arithmetic operations inside a `print` command. Running it will then print out the result of the operation. For example, the following program

```
print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)
```

prints out these lines:

Sample output

7
9
22

Notice the lack of quotation marks around the arithmetic operations above. Quotation marks are used to signify _strings_. In the context of programming, strings are sequences of characters. They can consist of letters, numbers and any other types of characters, such as punctuation. Strings aren't just words as we commonly understand them, but instead a single string can be as long as multiple complete sentences.
Strings are usually printed out exactly as they are written. Thus, the following two commands produce two quite different results:

```
print(2 + 2 * 10)
print("2 + 2 * 10")
```

This program prints out:

Sample output

22
2 + 2 \* 10

With the second line of code, Python does not calculate the result of the operation, but instead prints ou... [Content truncated for context window]

What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting. What can Python do? Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. Why Python? Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very qui...
