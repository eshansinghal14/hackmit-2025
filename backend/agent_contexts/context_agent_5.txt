# The Definitive Guide to Data Structures for Coding Interviews

- August 9, 2021

![data structures](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-image-template-6.jpg)

If you’ve been reading Byte by Byte for any length of time, then you know that I have one mantra that I repeat over and over again:

**Strategy, Strategy, Strategy**

This is the one biggest difference between those students who succeed and those who fail at their [coding interview](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/coding-interview-101/). It’s not who has studied the most problems. It’s not who grinds the most Leetcode. It’s not who is naturally the smartest.

The biggest difference is having a strategy for solving ANY problem, not just the ones you’ve seen before. [And this approach is why our students see such fantastic results](https://join.byte-by-byte.com/evergreen-optin).

But…

Here’s the thing about strategy: Without the proper building blocks in place, you’ll never succeed. That’s why [Data Structures](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/studying-data-structures-and-algorithms/) are so key.

Trying to nail a coding interview without having your Data Structures down cold is like trying to play basketball without knowing how to dribble. All the strategy in the world won’t help you be successful.

So in this post, I’m going to share with you ALL of the data structures and algorithms that you need to be successful in your coding interviews.

## Table of Contents

- [Arrays](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#arrays)
- [Strings](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#strings)
- [Linked Lists](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#linked-lists)
- [Sets](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#sets)
- [Maps](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#maps)
- [Stacks and Queues](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#stacks-and-queues)
- [Trees](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#trees)
- [Graphs](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#graphs)
- [Heaps](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/data-structures/#heaps)

One last note before we get into all these Data Structures. If you’re new to this stuff, there’s a lot to learn. This post may feel completely overwhelming. But you can do it!

Remember the following:

1. Take things one step at a time. Don’t worry about everything you have to learn. Just focus on learning one things first and then move on to the next.
2. [Apply these strategies for studying effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kKdmKrLbK0)
3. Focus on consistency. This is a marathon, not a sprint, so just focus on making consistent progress over time.

If you do these things, you’ll get your Data Structures nailed down in no time.

**What are Data Structures ?**

Data Structures are a type of data storage.

They are a method of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can effectively perform operations on it.

**Algorithms & Data Structures**

Consider the Data Structures you are familiar with while approaching an algorithm. What we want to consider is: what are their characteristics, and how can you use them to your advantage?

**Data Structures: There are several different types of data structures.**

# Array:

A data structure that contains a group of elements is known as an array. These items are often all of the same data type, such as an integer or a string

In computer programs, arrays are widely used to organize data so that a related group of numbers can be readily sorted or searched.

A numeric index is a number associated with each element in an array that allows you to access it. Arrays begin at zero and can be changed using a variety of methods.

# Hash Table:

A hash table (also known as a hash map, obje... [Content truncated for context window]

# Data Structures

## Introduction

Data structures are different ways of storing data such that they optimize certain data operations such as retrieval and insertion. Although many of these data structures are already built into various languages, it is important to understand how they work. By understanding the implementations, we can have a sense of which data structure to use for different scenarios.

An **abstract data type** is a conceptual model for representing data. An abstract data type tells what it should do as opposed to how it should work. It will tell us what operations it should have but should not tell us how to implement them.

For example, a bottle should be able to hold water and allow us to drink from it. This tells us what it should do but we don't need to know how it works or how it is made. A plastic water bottle is an implementation of a bottle. It holds water in its interior and allows us to drink by unscrewing the cap and letting us pour water down our throat. A thermos is also an implementation of the bottle, it has a lid that can be popped open. and water can come from it. A thermos and plastic water bottle are different implementations as they are made differently and used differently, but they fundamentally do what a bottle is supposed to do: store liquid and provide a way to drink. A bottle in the abstract does not actually exist, but types of bottles do.

![](https://thecshandbook.com/public_html/img/uploads/bottle.png)

Some implementations of abstract data types are better than others for different purposes. For example, plastic water bottles are very cheap, whereas a thermos is more expensive. However, a thermos can hold hot water and keep it warm for a longer period of time. When selecting a data structure, we should pick one based on the efficiencies of data operations that we will do most often.

![](https://thecshandbook.com/public_html/img/uploads/adt.png)

## [Stack](https://thecshandbook.com/Stack)

A **stack** is an abstract data type with the property that it can remove and insert elements following a FILO (First In Last Out) structure. The first element to be inserted must be the last element to be removed and the last element to be inserted must be the first element to be removed. Sometimes, removal is called "pop" and insertion is called "push".

Imagine a stack of plates at a buffet, the plates are taken from the top and are also replaced from the top. The first plate to go in will be the last plate to come out. The last plate to go in will be the first to come out. This structure is what a stack is.

Example of push:

![](https://thecshandbook.com/public_html/img/uploads/stack.png)

Example of pop:

![](https://thecshandbook.com/public_html/img/uploads/stack2.png)

Stacks are used to keep track of function calls in memory. Whenever a function is called, it is placed on the memory stack with its variables, and when it is returning a value, it is popped off the stack.

A stack is usually impl... [Content truncated for context window]

## What is a data structure?

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

In computer science and computer programming, a data structure might be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms -- commonly referred to as data structures and algorithms (DSA). In some cases, the algorithm's basic operations are tightly coupled to the data structure's design. Each data structure contains information about the data values; relationships between the data; and, in some cases, functions that can be applied to the data.

For instance, in an [object-oriented programming](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) language, the data structure and its associated methods are bound together as part of a class definition. In non-object-oriented languages, there might be functions defined to work with the data structure, but they aren't technically part of the data structure.

## Why are data structures important?

Typical base [data types](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/data-type), such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.

Data structures are the [building blocks for more sophisticated applications](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/feature/Why-understanding-data-structures-is-so-important-to-coders). They're designed by composing data elements into a logical unit representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application. An example of an abstract data type is a customer name that's composed of the character strings for first name, middle name and last name.

It's not only important to use data structures, but it's also important to choose the proper data structure for each task. Choosing an ill-suited data structure could result in slow [runtimes](https://... [Content truncated for context window]

Master essential data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues to efficiently manage dynamic data and boosting your overall programming efficiency.

Have you ever wondered how you can efficiently manage data that changes unpredictably? I recall when I first stumbled upon various data structures—it completely transformed how I handle dynamic information.

I'll guide you through essential data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues in this article. We'll explore their unique strengths and practical uses with code examples.

## Linked Lists Data Structures

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20height='1696'%20width='4476'%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Have you ever struggled with managing data that grows and shrinks unpredictably? I remember when I first stumbled upon linked lists—they changed how I approached dynamic data!

Linked lists offer a flexible, dynamic structure for efficient insertion and deletion; unlike arrays, which store elements contiguously in memory, linked lists consist of nodes connected via pointers. Each node holds data and a reference to the next node.

This setup shines when the dataset size isn't known upfront or frequent modifications are needed. It's beneficial for tasks requiring adaptability. We will use three different methods in this part, so let’s get started.

#### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is the simplest form, where each node points to the next in sequence. It's ideal when you only need to traverse the list in one direction.

Let's implement a simple singly linked list in Python. Each node will hold a member's financial information (e.g., plan\_premium) and point to the next node. We'll also add functionality to limit the number of displayed rows.

```
classNode:def__init__(self, data): self.data = data # Stores the data (e.g., financial value) self.next = None# Points to the next node in the list
classSinglyLinkedList:def__init__(self): self.head = None# Initial head of the list
# Insert a new node at the end of the listdefinsert(self, data): new_node = Node(data)
if self.head isNone:
 self.head = new_node
else:
 current = self.head
while current.next:
 current = current.next current.next = new_node

# Display the linked list, showing only the first few rowsdefdisplay(self, rows=5): current = self.head
 count = 0while current and count < rows:
print(f"Plan Premium: ${current.data:.2f}")
