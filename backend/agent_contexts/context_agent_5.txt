## Welcome to the Wonderful World of Linear Algebra!

In today’s age of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that holds the most relevance to computing.

Why learn Linear Algebra in computer science and data analytics? Its role is similar to that of the alphabet or vocabulary or grammar in learning a language. If we want to be a writer, for instance, we have to be good at all these aspects of the language of our choice. Having these background skills alone is not enough; it will not make us a writer. But what is absolutely certain is that _without_ these skills, we will _never_ be a writer, not a good one at any rate.Linear Algebra, in much the same way, is really the basic backdrop of several of the pivotal numerical algorithms in computer science and machine learning.

Report

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of vectors, vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations. It deals with linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and determinants. It has a wide range of applications in Physics and Mathematics. It is the basic concept for machine learning and data science.

Some applications of Linear Algebra are:

**Linear Algebra Equations**

> The general linear equation is represented as **u** ****1**** **x** ****1**** **\+ u** ****2**** **x** ****2**** **\+ ..... u** ****n**** **x** ****n**** **= v**

Where,

- u’s – represents the coefficients
- x’s – represents the unknowns
- v – represents the constant

There is a collection of equations called a System of linear algebraic equations. It obeys the linear function such as -

> (x1,……..xn) → u1x1 \+ ………. \+ unxn

## Types of Linear Algebra Study

Linear Algebra is divided into different branches based on the difficulty level of topics, which are,

- Elementary Linear Algebra
- Advanced Linear Algebra
- Applied Linear Algebra

## Foundations of Linear Algebra

Elementary linear algebra introduces the foundational concepts that form the building blocks of the subject. It covers basic operations on matrices, solving systems of equations, and understanding vectors.

## Story Time

Linear algebra was founded around the same time as Calculus (think Leibniz, circa 1700) solely for the purpose of solving general systems of linear equations. The coefficients of a system were written in a grid form, with rows corresponding to equations and columns to the unknown variables. Using a computational tool called the _determinant_ (an awkward, but computable formula involving only the coefficients of the equations in a system), researchers were able to solve these systems, opening a world of information about the positions of celestial bodies and large-scale measurements (of geodesic arcs) on the surface of the earth.

By the 1850’s, Arthur Cayley was representing matrices as abstract objects. He defined matrix multiplication and nurtured matrix theory as its own field, recognizing a vast wealth of theoretical knowledge underlying the theory of determinants. Around turn of the century, a formal system of vector algebra was invented which relied heavily on interpreting matrices as so-called _linear transformations._ Linear transformations are intuitively those maps of everyday space ($ \\mathbb{R}^n$) which preserve “linear” things. Specifically, they send lines to lines, planes to planes, etc., and they preserve the origin (one which does not preserve the origin is very similar but has a different name; see [Affine Transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation)). Soon enough the mathematical focus shifted to the foundations of such an algebra, and later with the advent of computers to rapid calculations in one.

## Motivations

Linear algebra sits at the crossroads of many areas of mathematics. Keeping close to its roots, linear algebra is primarily a tool for computation. Unsurprisingly, a huge chunk of mathematical research has been solely to phrase things in terms of matrices and their associated linear transformations. For instance, an undirected graph on $ n$ vertices can be modeled as a matrix of integer entries, with the $ i,j$ entry containing the number of edges from vertex $ i$ to vertex $ j$. This is called the _adjacency matrix_ of a graph. Suddenly, a wealth of information a... [Content truncated for context window]

# Lecture \#1: Linear Algebra - in a Nutshell

We begin by setting up various pieces of background material
related to linear algebra. The
theory here is of course not explained in the most generality,
but simplified and adapted to
our discussion. Denote first the set of all real numbers by
**R**.
A **vector** of length n is simply a list of
n elements, called vector
_entries_. The notation of a (column) vector v
having entries x1,
x2, …
,xn is the following:

**Example 1:** The entries of a
vector can in principle be anything: words, colors, numbers, etc.
The following are all examples of vectors:

However, we will only look at vectors whose entries are real
numbers (that is x1,
x2, …
,xn are all real numbers). As in the case
of real numbers, real vectors can be added or multiplied by a
real number (called _scalar_) in a
straightforward way:

**Example 2:** Under the
above two notation we can easily check that:

**Problem #1:**

1. Is it possible to multiply two vectors? How
about adding vectors of different lengths?
2. How many vectors of length 5 with integer
entries are there? What if we require that all entries be
different?

In a similar way we define the notion of a **matrix**. An
m × n matrix
is a rectangular array of entries having hight m and
width n. This can also
be seen as stacking n vectors of length m
one next to the other. Again, take
the entries to be real numbers. We denote an m ×
n matrix A
with entries aij by:

This means that on row i and column j we
find the real number aij.
For example, on the first row, second column lies element
a12.
Notice that a vector of length m is just a
m × 1 matrix and
a real number is a 1 × 1 matrix. If
m = n then
the matrix is called a _square matrix_, of _size_ n. This is what we will consider
from now on. It makes sense now to talk about the
_diagonal_ of a matrix, which consists of those elements
for which the row number equals the column number ( the elements
a11, a22,
up to ann).

**Example 3:** The
following are all examples of matrices, but only the last three are
square:

Notice that the last two matrices are rather "special": they are
_symmetric_. This means that entry on
row i and column j is equal to that entry
on row j and column i
(or otherwise said aij =
aji). As an easy exercise, prove that
any diagonal matrix (has zeros everywhere, except on the
diagonal) is symmetric. The matrix that has ones on
the diagonal and zeros everywhere else is called the
_identity_ matrix and is denoted by I.
Matrix multiplication is done in the following general way:

where the element cij is given by the
formula:
Multiplying a matrix with a vector is done as follows:
where every element yi from the resulting
vector y is given by the formula

The other two matrix operations, addition and scalar
multiplication, are done as in the case of vectors. Adding
matrices A and B gives a matrix C
which has the entry on row i and
column j equal to the sum of the corresponding
entries of A and B. Multiplying
matrix... [Content truncated for context window]

# Notes on Linear Algebra

_Warning for people trying to learn from these notes:_ I do linear algebra in a somewhat nonstandard way. Most linear algebra courses use the real and complex numbers. I use other number systems, which I describe in the first section on rings. You can still read a lot of the notes if you are just familiar with the real and complex numbers. If you notice that an example or discussion talks about "Z2" or "Z5" or something like that, it's a tipoff that it uses the "nonstandard" stuff. If you're taking a course which just uses the real and complex numbers, you could just ignore those examples or discussions. (Or you could read everything and surprise your instructor!)

A lot of the stuff that follows is directed toward instructors.

* * *

These are notes for a course in linear algebra. Students taking this course at Millersville University are assumed to have had, or be currently enrolled in, Calculus 3. Our Calculus 3 course covers vectors in 3 dimensions, including dot and cross products. Hence, my notes don't spend much time on basic vector arithmetic, since it would be redundant for our students. I may eventually say something about cross products as a digression in the sections on determinants, but right now they are not covered. Dot products occur as a special case of inner products in a later section. There are several sections on this material in my [Calculus 3 notes](https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/calculus3/calculus3-notes.html).

There are several things about these linear algebra notes that are a little unusual. The most significant is that I've done as much linear algebra as possible over fields of nonzero characteristic. In practice, I confine myself to examples over the integers mod 2, 3, and 5, but I think this is enough to get the point across. To this end, the first section discusses commutative rings with identity and fields.

(This may worry some instructors, but after teaching this way for many years I found it isn't a big deal. Students don't seem to have that much trouble with modular arithmetic, given some practice. And it makes a lot of the matrix computations very clean and simple when you're working over (say) Z3! I also think modular arithmetic deserves to be more widely taught. A typical proof of something in linear algebra where the ground ring is a commutative ring with identity rather than a field uses algebraic facts like commutativity of addition that everyone takes for granted. So if you just _do_ the proof without belaboring the fact that the ground ring isn't a field, it doesn't cause any confusion or puzzlement.)

Determinants are defined axiomatically, over a commutative ring with identity, and I think I've given complete proofs of all the results. The axiomatic presentation makes sense to me (probably because that was the way I learned linear algebra from the text by Hoffman and Kunze as an undergrad). It's a good opportunity to show students how an object can be defined by _... [Content truncated for context window]

# Mastering Linear Algebra - Key concepts like matrices, determinants and linear transformations

In this course, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of linear algebra, including key concepts like vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix operations.

Table of contents

## What is included in a linear algebra course?

The following 28 topics are typically included in a linear algebra course

1\. Vectors

A vector in physics represents a force with a given direction, magnitude and origin. But in linear algebra, a vector has the first two properties but lacks an origin. Therefore, it can be moved if you want.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/vectors)

* * *

2\. Lines and planes in space

The equation for a straight line is only defined for two dimensions. It does not however stop them from existing in higher dimensions, where we define them in parametric or vector form.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/lines-and-planes-in-space)

* * *

3\. Linear systems of equations

Bunching together several equations creates a system of equations, and a solution for the system must solve each of the system's equations. The system is said to be linear if each equation is of the form:
$$
a\_1x\_1 + a\_2x\_2 + \\ldots + a\_nx\_n
$$

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/linear-systems-of-equations)

* * *

4\. Gauss-Jordan

Gauss-Jordan is a method for solving a linear system of equations. Each system falls into one of three cases; unique solution, no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/gauss-jordan)

* * *

5\. Matrix arithmetics

Matrix arithmetics are defined for addition, subtraction and multiplication. For the two former the matrices must have equal dimensions and the operations are commutative. Multiplication is however not commutative, and is only defined for when the number of rows of the left matrix is equal to the number of columns of the right matrix.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/matrix-arithmetics)

* * *

6\. Inverse matrices

The inverse to a matrix is another matrix, and the product of the matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/inverse-matrices)

* * *

7\. Linear dependence

If a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors, the bunch is then considered as linearly dependent. If not, the vectors are considered to be linearly independent.

[Show more](https://www.elevri.com/courses/linear-algebra/linear-dependence)

* * *

8\. Solution space

A solution space is the vector space containing all solutions to a given system. It does follow the properties of vector spaces, so if $\\vec{x}\_1$ and $\\vec{x}\_1$ are solutions to
$$A\\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$$
then we have that
$$k\_1\\vec{x}\_1 + k\_2\\vec{x}\_2$$
is a solution for any values o... [Content truncated for context window]
