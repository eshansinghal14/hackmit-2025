### Introduction

_Computation_ is the process of _computing_ new values from old ones. That’s it. The values may be numbers or text or many other things, and a _computer_ is given some values and asked to compute new ones. For example, it could be given your grades in your courses and asked to compute your GPA (grade point average). Or it could be given the prices of the items in your shopping cart and asked to compute the total including tax. Or it could be given the positions of pieces on a chess board and asked to compute the best move for one of the players.

You probably knew that. But did you know that until quite recently, a computer was _someone_ that computes. That’s right. Computers were people who worked with (mostly) numerical values: counting votes, managing financial ledgers, solving scientific equations, etc. They often had mechanical devices such as old-fashioned adding machines or slide rules to help them, but the people were the ones who knew how to compute whatever it was they were computing.

Now, if you want to tell a human how to do something, first you need to know how to do it yourself. And then you need to be able to describe it to them in a language that they understand, using steps that they know how to do. If I want you to prepare a meal of spaghetti, first I need to know how to make spaghetti myself, and then I also need to be able to explain it to you in way that you understand and can follow. If I want you to compute a student’s GPA given their grades, first I need to know how to do it and then I need to tell you how to do it in a way that you understand and can do for yourself.

Of course, we’re not really interested in telling humans how to compute things. Since the mid-twentieth century, we have been able to build computing devices... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 5: How to Become a Python Developer Without a Degree in 2025

**Content:**
Succeeding as a Python Developer doesn't require a degree. With the right training and a strong portfolio, you can forge your career in Python development, working in roles such as Web Developer, Back-End Developer, or Database Engineer.

## Key Insights

- Python Developers can work on a range of projects such as websites, software, games, or digital applications, and can hold titles like Web Developer, Back-End Developer, and Database Engineer.
- While a degree can be beneficial, many employers consider a bootcamp or certificate program as valuable for entry-level Python positions.
- Python Development skills can vary by industry and role, with common requirements including HTML and CSS, Django/Django REST, and Git/GitHub.
- Building a professional portfolio is a crucial step in demonstrating your Python Development skills, and is a major component in certificate programs like the Python Developer Certificate from Noble Desktop.
- Making industry connections can be critical in advancing your career and can be achieved through resources like Python's international support community and networking groups.
- Noble Desktop offers a range of online and in-person Python classes and bootcamps for Development, data science and analytics, FinTech, and cybersecurity, led by instructors with practical expertise.

You might want to become a Python Developer but have not attended a college or university. You might also have a degree in an unrelated field. That doesn't mean you can't still find a great job in Python Development.

Some Development Pros freelance, some start through internships, and others get entry-level work after attending a Python bootcamp or certificate program. Read on to learn more.

## What is a Python Developer?

Python Developers are tech professionals who can work on websites, software, games, or digital applications. Unlike some career tracks, those who fit the requirements of Python Developer often hold alternate titles; these can include Web Developer, Back-End Developer, and Database Engineer, to name a few. Therefore, while most of these tech pros know tools like Django, SQL, and Git, not all Python Development Positions require the same skill set.

Responsibilities for Python Developers vary by industry as well as position. Some have to implement and maintain cybersecurity or integrate data storage solutions, while others mainly design and integrate Front-End elements with Back-End applications. Additional responsibilities can include web scraping, automation testing, and data visualization.

## UNIT I: Introduction to Python:

- ### Python versus Java


Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug, but Python is easier to use and easier to read. (Ref: [https://www.bmc.com/blogs/python-vs-java/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fblogs%2Fpython-vs-java%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0RvZMjC-FNSLYfp0SBfc2P))

- ### Python Interpreter and it’s Environment


Translator (Converting High level language such as english to computer readable form because computer can understand binary(0 or1) language only)

a) Compiler : IT reads all program then convert whole code into machine level language. ( Example : C programming, C++, Core Java)

b) **Interpreter :**

Its reads line by line and convert line by line into machine level language. (Example : Python3) : it helps to run the program.

c) **Assembler**: (covert Assembly level language to machine level language )

- Python installation


[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3101/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Fpython-3101%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2ifG49OLk1JQ8Bv0H8X7or)

Step to run python program in command prompt:

1. Open Notebook

2. Write python code in notebook file

Python is most of the time known as a helping language for programming designers, for developing control and the board, testing, and in numerous alternate ways.

Python coding for construct control of our functions and different programming purposes to get results.

### Python Language Base

Basic framework and Apache access for mechanized nonstop creation and testing. Startup or advanced for bug following and undertaking the executive’s problems and the solutions.

Python is a multi-purpose and deep-level programming language for advanced programming solutions.

Object-oriented programming in python and organized coding on computer programs are completely done in this, and large numbers of its functionalities are there.

It Supports practical programming and perspective arranged programming counting multiple functions and objects with the magic methods accessibility.

### How Python Works

There are different standards are frameworks of python language which deal with deep-level system access by means of expansions, including configuration by agreement and deep programming.

Python utilizes dynamic programming and a mix of reference coding projects.

And a cycle-recognizing bugs for the memory of the executive’s system.

It utilizes a dynamic function name goal error restricting. Which program ties strategy and variable names during code execution time.

Its plan offers some help for using programming in the program’s custom features. It has a filter, roadmap capabilities, and a list of appreciations, code references, function sets, and generator expressions.

The standard library of python has two modules iterations tools and functions that carry out using the instruments acquired from basic and standard programming.

### Python Language History

Python language’s central way of thinking is to grow up in the record and data manipulation with deep-level computer system access.

At the start, python was very limited in using language but now according to incorporating python language usage into every center of the programming project.

Python was intended to be more extensible by means of its features.

This minimal python set has made it especially famous for adding programmable connection that points to existing or new applications.

Python’s latest version of the release centers language with a huge standard library.

This effectively extensible coding originated from its framework with all features, which helps the language methodology and accessibility.
