From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Branch of mathematics

**Linear algebra** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) such as

a1x1+⋯+anxn=b,{\\displaystyle a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n}=b,}

[linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) such as

(x1,…,xn)↦a1x1+⋯+anxn,{\\displaystyle (x\_{1},\\ldots ,x\_{n})\\mapsto a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n},}

and their representations in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3)

In three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), these three planes represent solutions to linear equations, and their intersection represents the set of common solutions: in this case, a unique point. The blue line is the common solution to two of these equations.

Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), including for defining basic objects such as [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)), [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)) and [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)). Also, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis), a branch of [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_functions).

Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For [nonlinear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with [first-order approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_approximation), using the fact that the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mathematics)) of a [multivariate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_function) at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.

### Source 2: An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra – BetterExplained

**Content:**
Despite two linear algebra classes, my knowledge consisted of “Matrices, determinants, eigen something something”.

Why? Well, let’s try this course format:

- Name the course _Linear Algebra_ but focus on things called matrices and vectors
- Teach concepts like Row/Column order with mnemonics instead of explaining the reasoning
- Favor abstract examples (2d vectors! 3d vectors!) and avoid real-world topics until the final week

The survivors are physicists, graphics programmers and other masochists. We missed the key insight:

**Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.**

We can take a table of data (a matrix) and create updated tables from the original. It’s the power of a spreadsheet written as an equation.

Here’s the linear algebra introduction I wish I had, with a real-world stock market example.

## What’s in a name?

“Algebra” means, roughly, “relationships”. Grade-school algebra explores the relationship between unknown numbers. Without knowing x and y, we can still work out that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.

“Linear Algebra” means, roughly, “line-like relationships”. Let’s clarify a bit.

Straight lines are predictable. Imagine a rooftop: move forward 3 horizontal feet (relative to the ground) and you might rise 1 foot in elevation (The slope! Rise/run = 1/3). Move forward 6 feet, and you’d expect a rise of 2 feet. Contrast this with climbing a dome: each horizontal foot forward raises you a different amount.

Lines are nice and predictable:

- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, then going 10x as far should give a 10x rise (30 feet forward is a 10-foot rise)
- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, and 6 feet has a 2-foot rise, then (3 + 6) feet should have a (1 + 2) foot rise

In math terms, an operation F is linear if scaling inputs scales the output, and adding inputs adds the outputs:

In our example, $F(x)$ calculates the rise when moving forward x feet, and the properties hold:

## Linear Operations

An operation is a calculation based on some inputs. Which operations are linear and predictable? Multiplication, it seems.

Exponents ($F(x) = x^2$) aren’t predictable: $10^2$ is 100, but $20^2$ is 400. We doubled the input but quadrupled the output.

Surprisingly, regular addition isn’t linear either. Consider the “add three” function $F(x) = x + 3$:

We doubled the input and did not double the output. (Yes, $F(x) = x + 3$ happens to be the equation for an _offset_ line, but it’s still not “linear” because $F(10) \\neq 10 \\cdot F(1)$. Fun.)

So, what types of functions are _actually_ linear? Plain-old scaling by a constant, or functions that look like: $F(x) = ax$. In our roof example, $a = 1/3$.

But life isn’t _too_ boring. We can still combine multiple linear functions ($A(x) = ax, B(x) = bx, C(x)=cx$) into a larger one, $G$:

$G$ is still linear, since doubling the input continues to double the output:

We have “mini arithmetic”: multiply inputs by a constant, and add the results. It’s actually usefu... [Content truncated for context window]

> In this article, the author explores the relationship between mathematics and computer science, focusing on the core concepts of linear algebra and their various applications in computer science. Topics covered include linear systems, matrices, Gaussian elimination, vectors, vector spaces, vector-matrix multiplication, and transformations. These concepts are essential in fields such as machine learning, computer graphics, cryptography, and information theory.

* * *

## Introduction

**This article is part of a series called "** [**Log Base Two**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/log-base-two) **", a series dedicated to the relationship between math and computer science**.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've **excelled** in a total of 10 college courses in math:

01. Single-variable differential calculus

02. Single-variable integral calculus

03. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus

04. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions

05. Linear Algebra

06. Differential equations

07. Probability and statistics

08. Data analysis using R programming language

09. Multivariate statistics

10. Discrete math


For a large majority of those 10 classes, I ended up with A's.

Although, before college, I struggled a lot with math in the classroom, even though math had always been my favorite subject since I was in elementary school. I found it hard to truly grasp the concepts taught because my high school teachers were too focused on skill assessment. Instead of focusing on the actual concept being taught, I was too worried about how I was going to pass the test the following week.

Once I got to college, I realized that your math grade (or any grade for that matter) truly doesn't define your potential. Further, I'd argue that your success in math _education_ is heavily influenced by the quality of the teacher/professor's teaching.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest (in this case, computer science). Along the way, I hope to also supplement your math education with quality content. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and truly loving mathematics.

**New articles in this series are posted every Thursday. If you have any suggestions for a specific topic I should write about, please comment it down below!**

Linear Algebra Review and Reference
Zico Kolter
October 16, 2007
1 Basic Concepts and Notation
Linear algebra provides a way of compactly representing and operating on sets of linear
equations. For example, consider the following system of equations:
4x1 − 5x2 = −13
−2x1 + 3x2 = 9 .
This is two equations and two variables, so as you know from high school algebra, you
can find a unique solution for x1 and x2 (unless the equations are somehow degenerate, for
example if the second equation is simply a multiple of the first, but in the case above there
is in fact a unique solution). In matrix notation, we can write the system more compactly
as:
Ax = b
with A =

4 −5
−2 3 
, b =

13
−9

.
As we will see shortly, there are many advantages (including the obvious space savings)
to analyzing linear equations in this form.
1.1 Basic Notation
We use the following notation:
• By A ∈ R
m×n we denote a matrix with m rows and n columns, where the entries of A
are real numbers.
• By x ∈ R
n
, we denote a vector with n entries. Usually a vector x will denote a column
vector — i.e., a matrix with n rows and 1 column. If we want to explicitly represent
a row vector — a matrix with 1 row and n columns — we typically write x
T
(here
x
T denotes the transpose of x, which we will define shortly).
1
• The ith element of a vector x is denoted xi
:
x =





x1
x2
.
.
.
xn





.
• We use the notation aij (or Aij , Ai,j , etc) to denote the entry of A in the ith row and
jth column:
A =





a11 a12 · · · a1n
a21 a22 · · · a2n
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
am1 am2 · · · amn





.
• We denote the jth column of A by aj or A:,j :
A =


| | |
a1 a2 · · · an
| | |

.
• We denote the ith row of A by a
T
i
or Ai,::
A =





— a
T
1 —
— a
T
2 —
.
.
.
— a
T
m —





.
• Note that these definitions are ambiguous (for example, the a1 and a
T
1
in the previous
two definitions are not the same vector). Usually the meaning of the notation should
be obvious from its use.
2 Matrix Multiplication
The product of two matrices A ∈ R
m×n and B ∈ Rn×p
is the matrix
C = AB ∈ R
m×p
,
where
Cij =
Xn
k=1
AikBkj .
Note that in order for the matrix product to exist, the number of columns in A must equal
the number of rows in B. There are many ways of looking at matrix multiplication, and
we’ll start by examining a few special cases.
2
2.1 Vector-Vector Products
Given two vectors x, y ∈ R
n
, the quantity x
T
y, sometimes called the inner product or dot
product of the vectors, is a real number given by
x
T
y ∈ R =
Xn
i=1
xiyi.
Note that it is always the case that x
T
y = y
T x.
Given vectors x ∈ R
m, y ∈ Rn
(they no longer have to be the same size), xyTis called
the outer product of the vectors. It is a matrix whose entries are given by (xyT)ij = xiyj,
i.e.,
xyT ∈ R
m×n =





x1y1 x1y2 · · · x1yn
