America loves potatoes, but they are also a global favorite and the [fourth most popular food worldwide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674809/). Potatoes grow wild but were first cultivated as a crop in South America about 7,000 years ago. They require [less land and water](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30441846/) than other staple crops like rice and wheat.

Because fresh potatoes are relatively inexpensive and easy to grow, they once had a daily presence on American dinner plates. But popularity of fresh potatoes has gradually declined while processed potato products like French fries have increased. While often cited as the most consumed vegetable in the U.S., many health experts disagree with this categorization because of its lower nutrient content compared with other vegetables. For example, potatoes don’t count as vegetables on the [Healthy Eating Plate](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-eating-plate/).

Potatoes are nutrient-rich vegetables providing significant amounts of key shortfall nutrients. The white potato is an important source of essential nutrients, including potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B6, dietary fiber and magnesium, as well as important phytonutrients.

- Potatoes contain nutrients of public health concern including fiber and potassium. Read [Potatoes and Childhood Nutrition](https://apre.org/potato-science/healthy-lifestyles/potatoes-and-childhood-nutrition/) and [Healthy Dietary Patterns](https://apre.org/nutrition-science/healthy-dietary-patterns/) for more information.
- Potatoes provide about 20 percent of the potassium in the American diet. Based on research supported by APRE, the bioavailability of potassium is as high from potatoes as from potassium gluconate supplements (1).
- A collection of studies published in an _Advances in Nutrition_ supplement, supported by APRE, identified a substantial body of evidence that demonstrates how the inclusion of white vegetables, such as potatoes, can increase intake of shortfall nutrients as well as help increase overall vegetable consumption (2). The open-access supplement can be viewed [here](http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/3/318S.full).
- Potatoes are one of the best nutritional values in the produce department, providing valuable nutrients such as vitamin C and significantly better nutritional value per dollar than many other raw vegetables. A 2013 analysis examined the nutrient density per unit cost of the 46 most frequently consumed vegetables as part of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and found that potatoes and beans were the least expensive sources of not only potassium but also fiber. Specifically, potassium-rich white potatoes were almost half the cost of most other vegetables, making it more affordable to meet key dietary guidelines for good health (3).
- Potatoes contain surprisingly high-quality protein with a biological value between 90-100, which is considered very good, especially for a non-animal source (2).

### Source 4: The Best Pan-Roasted Potatoes

**Content:**
Featured Video The Best Pan-Roasted Potatoes "Gretchen wasn’t kidding when she named her potato dish 'The Best Pan-Roasted Potatoes.' The dish is absurdly simple in terms of ingredients, but it’s the contrasting play of colors and textures that make it worthy of a community pick. The step of keeping the wedges stuck together while the spuds fry results in a striking contrast of light and dark surfaces. One bite through a wedge leaves a delightful confusion on your palate, simultaneously chip-like in crunchiness and mashed potato-like in fluffiness, all in one bite. The flavor of the potatoes shines through in the absence of potentially overwhelming spices, but feel free to indulge yourself with a dash of your favorite seasonings." —Panfusine "I have long documented in this space my antipathy for side dishes, and my family has learned to accept a constant round of broccoli, green beans, and yeah, I’ll say it, sweet potato fries straight from the freezer bag. But sides got a whole new lease on life chez moi with The Best Pan Roasted Potatoes. The best thing here is the reminder to work with waxy potatoes, which really do make a difference in these pan roasted dishes. Yes, you do need patience, and that may not seem like a weeknight virtue—but while these are doing their thing for 12 minutes or so you can be chopping, stirring, or doing whatever else you need to do to get dinner on the table. Alternatively, you can ask your teenager about her boyfriend, her math homework, or the boyfriend who isn’t really her boyfriend, she says. That took 12 minutes! Okay, it took three. So now go ask another kid why their room looks like a Superfund site. Okay now you can check your potatoes. Brown! Spitting oil a little! Be careful. Once covered watch them carefully. Mine took 20 minutes to achieve that delicious sort of salty yield between the teeth. Eat on." —Jestei

By Julie Garden-Robinson, Food and Nutrition Specialist

NDSU Extension

When I was young, my midsummer task was to “sneak” potatoes from the sides of the potato hills in our garden.

We all liked cooked baby red potatoes served with butter, salt and pepper. We usually had fresh green beans and a lettuce salad along with some type of meat to complete our meal from the garden.

As I was looking at my towering potato plants in my backyard garden the other day, I felt a little nostalgic. I didn’t steal any potatoes from the hills, though.

I will let them grow to be large potatoes. I bought some baby red potatoes at the store to make this week’s recipe.

Potatoes sometimes get a bad rap related to their role in a healthful diet. Some people avoid them. However, avoiding potatoes could shortchange you on several important nutrients, including potassium, complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, fiber (especially if you eat the skin) and other nutrients.

If you slather a lot of extra ingredients on your cooked or baked potato, you may please your taste buds. However, you are not doing your overall health a huge favor by adding a lot of calories and, most likely, saturated fat.

Potassium is found in abundance in potatoes. You might be aware that bananas are a potassium source. A medium banana has 425 milligrams of potassium. One medium baked potato with the skin has 925 milligrams of potassium, which is more than twice as much potassium as a similar amount of banana.

Potassium is so important to our overall health that the latest Nutrition Facts labels now feature potassium as one of the listed nutrients. You also will see vitamin D and added sugar on the new labels.

The changes to the label crowded out vitamins A and C. We still need these nutrients, of course.

The nutrition labels were adjusted to focus on nutrients of concern and also keep the nutrition label the same size. You will notice that serving size is in a larger font so it catches our attention.

On average, an adult healthy male age 19 and older needs 3,400 milligrams of potassium and an adult healthy female needs 2,600 milligrams. Aim to get your nutrients from food, and be sure to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. Milk, yogurt and salmon also contribute significant amounts of potassium to our diet.

Why is potassium so important, anyway?

Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte. Our body needs potassium to help our heart and kidneys function. Maintaining the right level of potassium is important for your muscles and organs to function at their best. Having an adequate amount of potassium may help with blood pressure management.

Many Americans do not get the recommended amount of potassium from their diet as a result of shortchanging themselves on fruits and vegetables. About 90% of adults do not meet the daily recommendat... [Content truncated for context window]

## The Goodness in Potatoes

Potatoes are a very common food in the diets of most Europeans, but perhaps sometimes the nutrition contribution of this staple crop is overlooked. To start with, there are considerable nutritional differences between potato dishes depending on how they are cooked, and this may have an impact on how potatoes as a food are perceived by consumers. What makes potatoes special is that they combine the characteristics of starchy foods with those of vegetables.

![](https://en.sabriulkerfoundation.org/files/editor/133614642902953028-133608660652333276-patates-1.png)

First imported from South America in the 16th century, potatoes took another 150 years before actually becoming one of the most important staple food crops in Europe. Nowadays, Central and Eastern Europeans are the highest consumers, but potatoes play a role in diets all across the continent, with an average per capita consumption of 94 kg in 2005.1 Listed below are important and interesting nutritional aspects that are worth considering in the discussion on the contribution of potatoes towards a healthy balanced diet.2

1\. When boiled or baked, potatoes are a virtually fat-free food. The main energy-providing nutrient in potatoes is carbohydrate, in the form of starch. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body, and should supply at least half of your calories for the day. The advantage of getting carbohydrates from potatoes is that you will be getting a considerable amount of certain micronutrients as well. Potatoes contain a small amount of protein: about 3 g in a boiled medium portion of 180 g (see Table 1). Although this is less than 10% of the daily adult requirement, potatoes are a good source of the amino acids lysine and tryptophan and combined with milk or eggs make for a high quality protein food.

2\. Potatoes are a source of fibre, which contributes to the feeling of fullness, and supports healthy digestive functions. A 180 g portion of boiled potatoes provides about 3 grams of fibre, which equates to more than 10% of the daily recommended intake of fibre, namely 25 grams.3Some people enjoy the stronger taste of eating cooked potatoes with skins on, and in this form they contain even more fibre. However care must be taken not to eat skins that are discoloured or marked. Green patches indicate higher levels of glycoalkaloids such as solanine, which may lead to ill health if consumed in large amounts. A small amount of the starch in potatoes resists digestion (this is called ‘resistant starch’): this particularly occurs when potatoes are eaten cold after being cooked, such as in a potato salad. Resistant starch acts in the body in a similar way to fibre, and may aid in the control of blood glucose and blood lipid levels.4

3\. Potatoes are a steady reliable source of vitamin C – a medium... [Content truncated for context window]

Potato

### POTATO

There are over 4,000 edible varieties of potato, mostly found in the Andes of South America. Potato is the third most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption. More than a billion people worldwide eat potato, and global total crop production exceeds 300 million metric tons. Potato is a critical crop in terms of food security in the face of population growth and increased hunger rates. For example, China, the world’s biggest consumer of potatoes, expects that fully 50% of the increased food production it will need to meet demand in the next 20 years will come from potatoes.

Potato Facts and Figures

How Potato Grows

### HOW POTATO GROWS

The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is an herbaceous annual that grows up to 100 cm (40 inches) tall. As the potato plant grows, its compound leaves manufacture starch that is transferred to the ends of its underground stems (or stolons). The stems thicken to form a few or as many as 20 tubers close to the soil surface. The number of tubers that actually reach maturity depends on available moisture and soil nutrients. Tubers may vary in shape and size, and normally weigh up to 300 g (10.5 oz) each. At the end of the growing season, the plant’s leaves and stems die down to the soil level and its new tubers detach from their stolons. The tubers then serve as a nutrient store that allows the plant to survive the cold and later regrow and reproduce. Each tuber has from two to as many as 10 buds (or “eyes”), arranged in a spiral pattern around its surface. The buds generate shoots that grow into new plants when conditions are again favorable.

Potato Nutrition

### POTATO NUTRITION

Potatoes are an excellent, low-fat source of carbohydrates, with one-fourth the calories of bread. Boiled, they have more protein than maize and nearly twice the calcium. An average serving of potatoes with the skin on provides about 10 percent of the recommended daily intake of fiber.

Wanda and the 'Big Book of Things to Know by 8¾' learn all about her favourite vegetable, the potato Where do potatoes come from? Nearly everyone loves potatoes. Where would mealtimes be without them? Because of all the potatoes we eat on this island, you would think they came from here. They don’t! Archaeologists have discovered potato remains in South America from 2,500 years ago. If you think you love potatoes, you should see the pottery people made back then. They obviously adored potatoes. Some of the pots that were found had pictures of potato humans! But not much has changed in the way we eat potatoes today from the way people back then ate them. They mashed, baked, boiled and stewed their potatoes, just like we do. How do potatoes grow? Potatoes don’t grow from a simple seed. They grow from a seed potato. The seed potato has small sprouts on it and is ready to grow. When you forget about potatoes in the cupboard for a while, they might start sprouting like a seed potato. Before planting, the farmer ploughs the land and pushes the soil into ridges. After that, the farmer removes any stones. This is done to stop the stones squashing the potatoes as they grow underground. The farmer then plants the seed potatoes into the ridges and covers them with soil to protect them. Like many other vegetables grown here, potatoes are sown in the spring so the warmer weather can help them grow. After the potatoes are planted, they grow roots down into the soil. Then new shoots reach up through the soil towards sunlight, and soon there are green leaves above ground. The shoots produce energy to help the roots grow bigger and eventually become potatoes. Potatoes can only be grown in a field one year out of five years. This is because they take so many nutrients from the soil. Each year the farmer grows potatoes in a different field. Moving the potato crop around means the soil stays healthy for other crops. How did the potato come to Ireland? Even though potatoes had been eaten in other places for thousands of years, they didn’t appear in Europe until 1570. That’s over 450 years ago. Soon after, a famous explorer called Sir Walter Raleigh brought potatoes to Ireland. Potatoes were easier to grow for Irish farmers than other crops, such as wheat and oats. And, they soon discovered that the potato plant was really nutritious and gave you loads of energy for a full day's work. In the 1800s nearly half of Ireland’s population - mostly poor families - depended on the potato for their daily food. The potato was the perfect crop for Irish farmers to produce and for everyone to eat. Every year in Northern Ireland we spend more than £50 million on potatoes, so we need to grow a lot of them. Crisps! You might love potatoes best in the form of crisps! There are lots of different varieties of potatoes grown in Ireland. Some are suitable for making crisps, while others are used to make mash or chips. Once the potatoes have been harvested, they are stored in big wooden c... [Content truncated for context window]

## ![](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/food-technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2011/10/potatoes.jpg)Nutrition Information

Potatoes are rich in carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and potassium. They are moderately rich in Vitamin C (if not boiled), calcium, and folate (folic acid). When potatoes are compared with other vegetables, they are higher in calories (133 calories per medium potato) than others (excluding sweet corn) due to their starch composition, but they are naturally low in fat and sodium. Care needs to be taken, however, when adding high fat condiments to a baked potato (such as sour cream, butter, or margarine) because these items are the culprits that add excessive calories to the finished product.

## Planting and Harvesting Potatoes

The ideal time to plant seed potatoes in Central Texas in the spring is February to March; therefore, harvesting would occur May to June. In the fall, planting should occur August to September and harvest would then occur November to December.

| Plant Potatoes | Harvest Potatoes |
| --- | --- |
| February to March | May to June |
| August to September | November to December |

Planting and Harvesting Potatoes

## Storing Harvested Potatoes

Store in a cool, humid (but not wet), dark place. Do not wash before storing. Do not refrigerate.

## Choosing and Freezing Potatoes

Choose firm, and fairly smooth potatoes that are free from blemishes and sunburn (a green discoloration under the skin). Avoid potatoes that have sprouted or have wilted or wrinkled skin, green or dark areas, and ones with the presence of decay. To prepare potatoes for freezing, peel or scrape and wash. If frozen, diced potatoes are desired, dice the washed potatoes and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Drain and cool before placing in the appropriate freezer bags or containers; freeze, leaving 1/2″ head-space.

### Steps for Freezing Diced Potatoes

- Peel, scrape, and wash potatoes.
- Dice the potatoes to the desired size.
- Blanch for 2-3 minutes.
- Drain and cool before placing in freezer bags; freeze, leaving 1/2″ head-space.

If frozen French-fried potatoes are desired, peel mature potatoes and slice into 1/3″ X 3/8″ strips. Rinse in cold water and keep covered with water until ready to fry. Dry the potato strips. Fry small amounts of the potato strips in deep hot fat (360°F about 5 minutes until tender but not brown. Drain, cool, package in freezer bags, and freeze.

### Steps for Freezing French-fried Potatoes

- Peel the mature potatoes.
- Slice into 1/3″ X 3/8″ strips.
- Rinse in cold water and keep covered with water until ready to fry.
- Dry right before frying.
- Fry small amounts in deep hot fat (360°F for about 5 minutes until tender but not brown.
- Drain, cool, package, and freeze.
