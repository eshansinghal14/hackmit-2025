**Machine learning** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.

Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.

- [**Supervised Learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/supervised-machine-learning/) **:** Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
- [**Unsupervised Learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/): Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
- [**Reinforcement Learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/what-is-reinforcement-learning/): Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.

> **Note:** The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.

### Source 2: What Is Machine Learning? (2025 Guide)

**Content:**
Machine learning uses statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data, including numbers, words, images, clicks, and anything else that can be stored digitally.

Machine learning technology powers many of the services we rely on today, including recommendation systems like those found on Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, and Spotify. Machine learning is also key to the functionality of search engines, social media feeds like Facebook and Twitter, and voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.

In all of these instances, these platforms use machine learning to collect as much data about you as possible — which directors you like, what links you’re clicking, which statuses have provoked a reaction from you — and then make a highly educated guess about what you might want to buy, watch, or click next. Voice assistants, meanwhile, use machine learning to surmise which words match best with the sounds coming out of your mouth.

The process is, in fact, not that complicated: find the pattern, apply the pattern. But it pretty much runs the world. That’s in big part thanks to an invention in 1986, courtesy of Geoffrey Hinton, today known as the father of deep learning.

## Machine Learning Methods

There are several main basic types of machine learning methods or ML paradigms:

### Supervised learning

**Supervised learning** (SL) allows you to collect data or produce a data output from a previous machine learning deployment. With supervised tasks, we give the computer a collection of labeled input-output data points called a training set that are used to train a system to classify data or make accurate outcome predictions. Supervised machine learning actually works in much the same way humans learn. The most popular paradigm for machine learning, supervised learning involves feeding input data into a machine learning algorithm or model, which adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately.

Some common applications for supervised learning algorithms include email spam filters, face recognition tech, and Internet ad placement.

### Unsupervised learning

**Unsupervised learning** helps you find all kinds of unknown patterns in data. The opposite of SL, unsupervised machine learning involves combing through unlabeled data to discover patterns that ultimately solve association or clustering problems. Machine learning algorithms are fed large amounts of data and equipped with the tools to understand the data. It then learns to cluster or organize that data in such a way that a human could understand it. Two common unsupervised learning tasks are clustering and dimensionality reduction.

You might see unsupervised learning in the recommendation systems on a streaming service or targeted ads based on buying habits or browsing data.

### Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a series of decisions. Where supervised and unsupervised learning are associated based on the presence or lack of ... [Content truncated for context window]
