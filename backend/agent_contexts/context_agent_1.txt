Learn how advanced data structures allow businesses to create more efficient algorithms and effective programs to gain a competitive edge and enhance their growth.

Table of Contents

- What are data structures?
- Why are data structures important?
- Types of data structures explained
- Wrapping up

## What are data structures?

Data structures are a way of organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data on a computer.

Users can quickly access and update arranged information, enabling them to manipulate and use the data easily.

There are several types of basic and advanced data structures — which one an organization chooses depends on specific system requirements.

## Why are data structures important?

Businesses have an increasing amount of data and need structured ways of managing it. By organizing information in an easy-to-understand way, data structures allow users to access and utilize data as needed.

Data structures help create robust, efficient, and maintainable software systems — integral to an organization’s performance. They are the foundation for various algorithms and processing techniques, allowing for effective problem-solving in computer and software development domains.

They are useful to businesses for several reasons, providing a wealth of benefits for their growth, integrity, and efficiency.

### Data storage and retrieval

Efficient data storage is the top-level benefit of data structures. They provide optimized algorithms and data organization techniques for faster access and information processing. This improves system performance and responsiveness, which is crucial for businesses with substantial data volumes.

### Data abstraction

With data structures, businesses work with data more intuitively and logically. This means developers can focus on their programs' overall design and functionality without getting bogged down with data storage details.

### Data analysis

Advanced data structures let businesses perform complex data analysis and gain valuable insights. They represent and analyze relationships between data points, enabling businesses to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.

### Algorithms

Different data structures help optimize algorithms businesses use to solve complex problems efficiently. For example, specific advanced data structures can process tasks based on priority, ensuring critical operations are handled quickly.

### Real-time processing

Businesses often deal with real-time data streams that need quick processing and analysis. Advanced data structures help by efficiently inserting, retrieving, and manipulating data. This is particularly useful in finance, e-commerce, and logistics industries.

### Data integrity and security

Advanced data structures offer techniques to ensure data integrity and security. Different structures can secure data storage and retrieval or enforce access control and permissions. By leverag... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 4: Must-Know Data Structures for Coding Interviews - Level Up Coding

**Content:**
## Must-Know Data Structures for Coding Interviews

If you prefer to follow along via my YouTube video, you can watch it here:

Data structures are used to store information in our code. We use different data structures to allow us to add, access, and delete data in the most efficient and applicable ways to solve our problems. In interviews, choosing the right data structure could allow you to reduce the time complexity of your solution, something that is greatly valued by companies. I know I have been stuck unable to optimize some of my interview questions just because I used the wrong data structure. Therefore, today we will be going over the must-know data structures for coding interviews.

If this post is helpful, please consider [subscribing to my YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/sub2rahul) or following me on medium for more content like this! If you’re looking for a good resource to learn these data structures, I recommend picking up a copy of [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://amzn.to/2YBZWJ3) which goes over all of these and more in detail! Also if you haven’t already, check out my last article on the [Must Know Algorithms for Coding Interviews](http://bit.ly/interviewalgorithms)!

> Disclaimer: This post is created based off my experience looking for internships and entry level (new grad) roles. At any point if I state you need to know a data structure, this means you should understand reasons to use it, time complexity to insert, lookup, and delete elements, tradeoffs between it and others, and know how to implement it in the language of your choice. If I mention Big-O at any point in the article, I am referring to the industry usage of the term (it is equivalent to Big-Theta in academia). Also, the link to Cracking the Coding Interview on Amazon is an affiliate link and I will receive a commission if you purchase anything on Amazon using my link. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s get to the list!

## 1\. Array

Arrays are a basic data structure that is usually built into most languages. They are important for two main reasons. First, arrays are often the parameters to your coding questions in interviews. Therefore, having a strong understanding of them will ensure you can be successful in interviews. Second, you can implement most other data structures with an array, so you cannot understand how many other data structures are implemented without having a fundamental understanding of arrays.

## 2\. Linked List

Linked Lists are similar to arrays in that they are common in interviews and can be used to implement some other data structures. For this one, I highly recommend understanding how to implement this as well as adding methods to add, lookup, and delete values from the list. I have had interviews in which I have been asked to implement a Linked List from scratch, so I know it has a chance of coming up in your interviews!

Stack and queues are opposite data structures. Each can be implemented with... [Content truncated for context window]

Data Structures [view\
markdown](https://github.com/csinva/csinva.github.io/blob/master/_notes/cs/data_structures.md)

Some notes on advanced data structures, based on UVA's "Program and Data Representation" course.

* * *

## lists

## arrays and strings

- start by checking for null, length 0
- _ascii_ is 128, extended is 256

## queue - linkedlist

- has insert at back (enqueue) and remove from front (dequeue)


```
class Node {
Node next;
int val;
public Node(int d) { val = d; }
}

```

- finding a loop is tricky, use visited
- reverse a linked list
 - requires 3 ptrs (one temporary to store next)
 - return pointer to new end

## stack

```
class Stack {
 Node top;
 Node pop() {
 if (top != null) {
 Object item = top.data;
 top = top.next;
 return item;
 }
 return null;
 }
 void push(Object item) {
 Node t = new Node(item);
 t.next = top;
 top = t;
 }
}

```

- sort a stack with 2 stacks
 - make a new stack called ans
 - pop from old
 - while old element is > ans.peek(), old.push(ans.pop())
 - then new.push(old element)
- stack with min - each el stores min of things below it
- queue with 2 stacks - keep popping everything off of one and putting them on the other
- sort with 2 stacks

## trees

- Balanced binary trees are generally logarithmic
 - Root: a node with no parent; there can only be one root
 - Leaf: a node with no children
 - Siblings: two nodes with the same parent
 - Height of a node: length of the longest path from that node to a leaf
 - Thus, all leaves have height of zero
 - Height of a tree: maximum depth of a node in that tree = height of the root
 - Depth of a node: length of the path from the root to that node
 - Path: sequence of nodes n1, n2, …, nk such that ni is parent of ni+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k
 - Length: number of edges in the path
 - Internal path length: sum of the depths of all the nodes
- Binary Tree - every node has at most 2 children
- Binary Search Tree - Each node has a key value that can be compared
 - Every node in left subtree has a key whose value is less than the root’s key value
 - Every node in right subtree has a key whose value is greater than the root’s key value

```
void BST::insert(int x, BinaryNode * & curNode){ //we pass in by reference because we want a change in the method to actually modify the parameter (the parameter is the curNode *)
 //left associative so this is a reference to a pointer
 if (curNode==NULL)
 curNode = new BinaryNode(x,NULL,NULL);
 else if(x element)
 insert(x,curNode->left);
 else if(x>curNode->element)
 insert(x,curNode->right);
}

```

- BST Remove
 - if no children: remove node (reclaiming memory), set parent pointer to null
 \- one child: Adjust pointer of parent to point at child, and reclaim memory
 \- two children: successor is min of right subtree
 \- replace node with successor, then remove successor from tree
 - worst-case depth = n-1 (this happens when the data is already sorted)
 - maximum number of nodes in tree of height h is 2^(h+1) - 1
 - minimum height... [Content truncated for context window]

# Data Structures

- Contiguously-allocated structures are composed of single slabs of memory, and include arrays, matrices, heaps, and hash tables.
- Linked data structures are composed of distinct chunks of memory bound together by _pointers_, and include lists, trees, and graph adjacency lists.

## Arrays

- Built from fixed-size records.
- Constant access time given the index.
- Space efficient – arrays consist only of the data, so no space is wasted with links or formatting info.
- Easy to iterate over quickly, because of memory locality.
- Cannot adjust their size in the middle of a program's execution.
- _Dynamic arrays_ double in size whenever insert index is out of bound (Java's `ArrayList` is dynamic, while `int[]` isn't).
- Java array max length is `Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2^31-1` (but could actually be a bit shorter because of reserved memory).

## Linked Lists

- Singly-linked – each elements links to the next one.
- Doubly-linked – each elements links to the next and previous elements (Java's `LinkedList` is doubly-linked).
- Operations supported: search, insert, delete.
- Cannot overflow (as opposed to static arrays which have a finite length).
- Simpler insertion/deletion than arrays.
- Requires extra memory for pointers than arrays.
- Not efficient for random access to items.
- Worse memory locality than arrays.

## Stacks and Queues

- Stacks – LIFO (push, pop)
 - Very efficient, good to use when retrieval order doesn't matter at all (like for batch jobs).
 - LIFO usually happens in recursive algorithms.
- Queues – FIFO (enqueue, dequeue)
 - Average "waiting time" for jobs is identical for FIFO and LIFO. Maximum time varies (FIFO minimizes max waiting time).
 - Harder to implement, appropriate when order is important.
 - Used for searches in graphs.
- Stacks and Queues can be effectively implemented by dynamic arrays or linked lists. If upper bound of size is known, static arrays can also be used.

## Dictionary Structures

- Enable access to data items by content (key).
- Operations: search, insert, delete, max, min, predecessor/successor (next or previous element in sorted order).
- Implementations include: **hash tables**, **(binary) search trees**.

## Binary Search Trees

- Each node has a key, and _all_ keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, _all_ those in the right are bigger.
- Operations: search, traversal, insert, delete.
- Searching is `O(log(n)) = O(h)`, where `h = height` of the tree ( `log(n)` for 2 child nodes in each tree root, if tree is perfectly balanced).
- The min element is the leftmost descendant of the root, the max is the rightmost.
- Traversal in `O(n)`, by traversing the left node, processing the item and traversing the right node, recursively... [Content truncated for context window]

# 5\. Data Structures [¶](https://docs.python.org/docs.python.org\#data-structures)

This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail,
and adds some new things as well.

## 5.1. More on Lists [¶](https://docs.python.org/docs.python.org\#more-on-lists)

The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list
objects:

list.append( _x_)

Add an item to the end of the list. Similar to `a[len(a):] = [x]`.

list.extend( _iterable_)

Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Similar to
`a[len(a):] = iterable`.

list.insert( _i_, _x_)

Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the
element before which to insert, so `a.insert(0, x)` inserts at the front of
the list, and `a.insert(len(a), x)` is equivalent to `a.append(x)`.

list.remove( _x_)

Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to _x_. It raises a
[`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) if there is no such item.

list.pop(\[ _i_\])

Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index
is specified, `a.pop()` removes and returns the last item in the list.
It raises an [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#IndexError) if the list is empty or the index is
outside the list range.

list.clear()

Remove all items from the list. Similar to `del a[:]`.

list.index( _x_\[, _start_\[, _end_\]\])

Return zero-based index of the first occurrence of _x_ in the list.
Raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) if there is no such item.

The optional arguments _start_ and _end_ are interpreted as in the slice
notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of
the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full
sequence rather than the _start_ argument.

list.count( _x_)

Return the number of times _x_ appears in the list.

list.sort( _\*_, _key=None_, _reverse=False_)

Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort
customization, see [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sorted) for their explanation).

list.reverse()

Reverse the elements of the list in place.

list.copy()

Return a shallow copy of the list. Similar to `a[:]`.

An example that uses most of the list methods:

```
>>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']
>>> fruits.count('apple')
2
>>> fruits.count('tangerine')
0
>>> fruits.index('banana')

Clojure has a rich set of data structures. They share a set of properties:

- They are immutable

- They are read-able

- They support proper value equality semantics in their implementation of equals

- They provide good hash values

- In addition, the collections:



- Are manipulated via interfaces.

- Support sequencing

- Support persistent manipulation.

- Support metadata

- Implement java.lang.Iterable

- Implement the non-optional (read-only) portion of java.util.Collection or java.util.Map


## nil

nil is a possible value of any data type in Clojure. nil has the same value as Java null. The Clojure conditional system is based around nil and false, with nil and false representing the values of logical falsity in conditional tests - anything else is logical truth. In addition, nil is used as the end-of-sequence sentinel value in the sequence protocol.

## Numbers

Clojure provides full support for JVM primitive values by default, allowing high performance, idiomatic Clojure code for numeric applications.

Clojure also supports the Java boxed number types derived from java.lang.Number, including BigInteger and BigDecimal, plus its own Ratio type. There is some special handling:

### Longs

By default Clojure operates with natural numbers as instances of Java’s long primitive type. When a primitive integer operation results in a value that is too large to be contained in a primitive value, a java.lang.ArithmeticException is thrown. Clojure provides a set of alternative math operators suffixed with an apostrophe: +', -', \*', inc', and dec'. These operators auto-promote to BigInt upon overflow, but are less efficient than the regular math operators.

### Ratio

Represents a ratio between integers. Division of integers that can’t be reduced to an integer yields a ratio, i.e. 22/7 = 22/7, rather than a floating point or truncated value.

### Contagion

BigInts and floating point types are "contagious" across operations. That is, any integer operation involving a BigInt will result in a BigInt, and any operation involving a double or float will result in a double.

## Introduction

A data structure is a representation of data and a collection of associated operations [\[1, P. 5\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#open-data-structures).

Data structures are implementations of abstract data types [\[1, P. 4\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#open-data-structures).

### Abstract data types

ADTs (Abstract Data Types) define the set of operations supported by a data structure [\[1, P. 4\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#open-data-structures).

An ADT is the interface of a data structure, it doesn’t define how a data structure implements the operations [\[1, P. 4\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#open-data-structures).

There can be many implementations of an ADT [\[1, P. 4\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#open-data-structures).

## Contiguous vs Linked data structures

Data structures can be either **contiguous** in memory, or **linked** with pointers.

Contiguously allocated structures are built from a single slab of memory. They include arrays, matrices, and heaps [\[2, P. 66\]](https://notes.eddyerburgh.me/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures#algorithm-design-manual).
