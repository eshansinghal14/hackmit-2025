# Mastering the basics of single variable calculus - A beginner's guide

In this course, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of single variable calculus, including key concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals.

Table of contents

## What is included in a calculus course?

The following 23 topics are typically included in a calculus course

1\. Limits

Functions are not always defined for all inputs. For instance, division by zero is not allowed. To see how the function look close to such an input, we study the limit as the input goes toward this point.

2\. Continuity

Integers are considered discrete numbers; they are distributed with gaps in-between them. The set of real numbers, however, is continuous, since between any two reals you will always find more of them. The same concept extend to functions, where a continuous function is one with no gaps.

3\. Derivatives

The derivative of a function gives its instantaneous rate of change at any point. This is analogous to the slope of a line parallel to the function there, which, together with the concept of limits, formulate the definition of the derivative:
$$f'(x) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

4\. Differentiation rules

Finding derivatives is not always straight-forward using the definition. Luckily, the subject is well-researched, and multiple handy rules have been discovered, simplifying the task depending on the form of the function.

5\. Mean value theorem

The mean value theorem is simple, yet powerful: Between any two points on a continuous function, the derivative will somewhere equal the slope of the line connecting the points.

6\. Implicit derivatives

If y is not a function of x, but we still have a relation between the two through some equation, we can not formulate the derivative as a function of x. This is the case for a circle with radius $a$:
$$x^2 + y^2 = a^2$$
A line tangent to this circle will have the slope $ -\\frac{y}{x}$. This derivative is implicit, as opposed to explicit as a function of $x$ alone.

7\. Inverse functions

A function is a way of processing numbers. You plug in some number and get out a new one. The inverse of a function is then a redo-process, which takes in the old output, and spits out the initial input.

8\. Antiderivatives

As hinted by the name, antiderivatives are the reverses of derivatives. If a function $f(x)$ has the derivative $f'(x)$, $... [Content truncated for context window]

# Helping With Calculus

Calculus is the mathematics of change. In algebra we covered linear functions, the word linear refers to straight lines, straight lines represent change, but change that is at a constant rate (i.e. like a car driving at a constant speed).
In calculus we will start to look at functions and lines where the changeâ€¦ changes! For example, if a car driving at a constant speed is represented by a straight linear line, then we will use calculus to look at a car driving where its speed is changing (like if it was going down hills or being stuck behind cyclists etc.)
