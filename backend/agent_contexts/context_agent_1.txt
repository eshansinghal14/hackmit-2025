# Basic Calculus Concepts to Know for Math for Non-Math Majors
#### Related Subjects
[ðŸ’¯ Math for Non-Math Majors](https://library.fiveable.me/contemporary-math)
Calculus helps us understand how things change and accumulate. By exploring functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals, we can analyze real-world situations, optimize outcomes, and model growth or decay, making it relevant for everyday life and various fields.
01. **Functions and their graphs**
- A function is a relationship that assigns exactly one output for each input.
- Graphs visually represent functions, showing how outputs change with inputs.
- Key features of graphs include intercepts, slopes, and asymptotes.
02. **Limits and continuity**
- A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point.
- Continuity means a function has no breaks, jumps, or holes in its graph.
- Understanding limits is essential for defining derivatives and integrals.
03. **Derivatives and differentiation rules**
- A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable.
- Common differentiation rules include the power rule, product rule, and quotient rule.
- Derivatives can be used to find slopes of tangent lines to curves at specific points.
04. **Applications of derivatives (e.g., optimization, rates of change)**
- Derivatives help identify maximum and minimum values of functions (optimization).
- They are used to calculate instantaneous rates of change in various contexts.
- Understanding critical points (where the derivative is zero or undefined) is crucial for optimization.
05. **Integrals and basic integration techniques**
- An integral represents the accumulation of quantities, such as area under a curve.
- Basic techniques include the power rule for integration and substitution.
- Definite integrals provide numerical values, while indefinite integrals yield general functions.
06. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
- This theorem connects differentiation and integration, showing they are inverse processes.
- It states that the integral of a function can be evaluated using its antiderivative.
- It provides a method for calculating definite integrals efficiently.
07. **Applications of integrals (e.g., area under curves, volume)**
- Integrals can be used to calculate the area between curves and the x-axis.
- They are also used to find volumes of solids of revolution through methods like disk and washer.
- Applications extend to physics, economics, and biology for modeling real-world scenarios.
08. **Exponential and logarithmic functions**
- Exponential functions grow rapidly and are characterized by a constant base raised to a variable exponent.
- Logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions and help solve equations involving exponentials.
- Both types of functions are essential in model... [Content truncated for context window]
