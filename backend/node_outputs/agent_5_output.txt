Okay, so I need to generate the knowledge nodes for Agent 5 on linear algebra, but the problem is that there are no assigned sources. Hmm. The user mentioned that each agent analyzes different sources, but in this case, Agent 5 has no search results. Maybe the other agents have already taken all the sources, leaving none for me.

Wait, the user's instruction says that I should base the nodes strictly on the content provided in the sources assigned to me. Since there are no sources provided, how can I do that? The output format requires listing the nodes and a source summary with the number of sources analyzed and coverage. If I have zero sources, then I can't extract any nodes. 

But the user expects me to generate the nodes anyway. Maybe I should explain that there are no sources assigned here, so I can't proceed. Let me check the original query again. The user provided no sources for Agent 5 and asked me to extract nodes based on that. 

I think the correct approach is to point out that without any assigned sources, I can't extract any knowledge nodes. The source summary would indicate zero sources and zero coverage. Therefore, the knowledge nodes list will be empty. I need to make sure that I'm not making up any information or nodes based on my own knowledge. The user specifically wants the nodes to be based on the assigned sources, which in this case are none.

So the final answer should state that no knowledge nodes can be extracted due to lack of sources and provide the source summary accordingly. I need to follow the exact output format as specified, even if it means listing zero nodes.

**Agent 5 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**  

1. [Node Name]  
2. [Node Name]  
3. [Node Name]  
4. [Node Name]  
5. [Node Name]  

**Source Summary:**  
- Sources Analyzed: 0  
- Agent Coverage: 0 of 8 total sources  

**Note:** No actionable knowledge nodes can be extracted due to the absence of assigned research sources. The source summary reflects zero input data for analysis.
