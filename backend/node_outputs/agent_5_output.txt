Okay, as Agent 5 for "basic_calculus", I need to analyze the research sources assigned to me and extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes. But according to the context, there are no search results available for this agent. That's a problem. Without any sources to analyze, I can't extract any knowledge nodes related to basic calculus. I'm in a tricky situation here.

Since no sources are provided, I can't generate any nodes that are based on actual research content. The output format requires me to list knowledge nodes in a specific structure, but without sources to draw from, I shouldn't be making up information or guessing what might be in the sources. I need to be responsible and only provide information that's directly supported by the sources I've analyzed.

This means I should be transparent about the lack of sources. I can't fulfill my mission of generating specialized knowledge nodes when there are no sources to analyze. The output format should reflect this reality rather than listing fabricated or guessed nodes. I need to make sure the system knows that no analysis was possible due to the absence of assigned research sources. This is important for the coordination with the other agents and for ensuring the final knowledge map is accurate and reliable.

**Agent 5 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. [No applicable knowledge node extracted - no sources provided]
2. [No applicable knowledge node extracted - no sources provided]
3. [No applicable knowledge node extracted - no sources provided]

**Source Summary:**
- Sources Analyzed: 0
- Agent Coverage: 0 of 8 total sources

**Note:** As Agent 5, I cannot extract knowledge nodes without assigned research sources. The absence of source material prevents identification of specific concepts, techniques, or methodologies related to basic calculus.
