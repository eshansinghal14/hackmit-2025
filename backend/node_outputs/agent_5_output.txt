Okay, let's see. I need to generate knowledge nodes for basic calculus as Agent 5. The user mentioned that there are no search results available for this agent, so I can't refer to external sources. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the fundamental concepts that are essential in basic calculus. 

First, I remember that limits are a cornerstone of calculus. Understanding how functions behave as they approach a certain point is crucial. So maybe "Limits and Their Formal Definition" is a good node.

Next, derivatives. The concept of a derivative as the rate of change or slope of a function. Important techniques like the power rule, product rule, and chain rule come to mind. So "Derivatives: Rules and Applications" could be another node.

Then, integrals. The difference between definite and indefinite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus linking derivatives and integrals. That seems like a key point. Maybe "Integration Techniques and Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."

Also, optimization problems using derivatives. Applying calculus to find maximums and minimums in real-world scenarios. That's practical and a common application. Let's call that "Optimization in Real-World Problems Using Derivatives."

Lastly, related rates. How different quantities change in relation to each other, often involving time. This is another application of derivatives. So "Related Rates: Solving Dynamic Change Problems."

Wait, but the user said to base nodes strictly on the content provided in the sources. Since there are no sources, maybe I'm supposed to come up with the most essential concepts based on my own knowledge? But the instructions mention that each agent's sources are different and we can't duplicate. Since there are no sources for Agent 5, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, the user expects me to generate nodes regardless. I have to proceed by assuming that even without specific sources, the standard topics in basic calculus can be outlined as key nodes. Let me confirm if these are indeed the core concepts. Limits, derivatives, integrals, optimization, related rates. Yes, those are fundamental. I think that's acceptable here. Alright, I'll structure them as specified.
