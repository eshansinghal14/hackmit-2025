**Agent 5 Knowledge Nodes for: Python Programming**

1. **Python Setup and Execution Methods**  
   Python can be executed interactively via the interpreter prompt (`>>>`), by running `.py` files using `python filename.py`, or as standalone executable scripts on Unix/Linux systems using the shebang `#!/usr/bin/python` and `chmod +x`. The language is interpreted, allowing immediate code execution, which supports rapid prototyping and debugging.

2. **Basic Syntax and Structure Fundamentals**  
   Python emphasizes clean, readable syntax with rules including case sensitivity, use of indentation for code blocks, and specific identifier naming conventions (must start with a letter or underscore, contain only letters, digits, or underscores, and cannot be a reserved keyword). The core language structure includes variables, types, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions.

3. **String Handling and Quotation Rules**  
   Strings in Python are defined using either single or double quotation marks and are handled as sequences of characters. Quotes can be nested as long as they donâ€™t conflict (e.g., double quotes inside single-quoted strings and vice versa). Multiline strings are supported using triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`), enabling clean formatting of long text blocks.

4. **Arithmetic Operations and Expression Evaluation**  
   Python supports standard arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) that can be directly used within `print()` statements. Expressions are evaluated when not enclosed in quotes; when enclosed in quotes, they are treated as strings and printed verbatim, demonstrating the distinction between code execution and string literals.

5. **Python Development Tools and Learning Resources**  
   A wide range of structured learning pathways and tools are available, including free online tutorials (e.g., Python-course.eu, MOOC.fi), official documentation (docs.python.org), virtual environments, and specialized training in data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and web frameworks (Django). These resources support beginners through advanced developers in mastering Python programming.
