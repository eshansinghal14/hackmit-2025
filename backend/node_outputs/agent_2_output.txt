**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. **Core Visual Foundations of Calculus** – Illustrated concepts such as limits, slopes of tangents (derivatives), and areas under curves (integrals) that provide an intuitive, picture‑based entry point to calculus fundamentals.  

2. **Progressive Math Pathway Toward Calculus** – A structured learning sequence (Pre‑Algebra → Algebra → Geometry → Algebra 2 → Pre‑Calculus → Calculus) that builds the prerequisite skills necessary for successful calculus study.  

3. **Why Calculus Is Powerful: Real‑World Modeling** – Emphasizes calculus as the mathematical engine behind change‑based modeling (e.g., motion, growth, optimization) and highlights its central role in science, engineering, economics, and data analysis.  

4. **Online Learning Ecosystem for Calculus** – Consolidated resources from TC Math Academy (course catalogs, video lessons, and downloadable notes) that deliver self‑paced, multimedia instruction for both beginners and advanced learners.  

5. **Targeted Skill‑Rebuilder Modules** – Short, focused courses designed to fill gaps in foundational topics (e.g., limits, functions, trigonometry) before tackling full‑scale calculus, ensuring learners have the necessary conceptual scaffolding.
