**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Vector Spaces and Linear Transformations**: Linear algebra studies vectors and linear functions to solve systems of linear equations with multiple variables, focusing on calculating vectors and matrices. Vector spaces have 10 axioms that vectors follow when adding and multiplying, and linear transformations can be represented by matrices.
2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Eigenvalues are values that satisfy the equation Ax = λx, where A is a matrix, x is a vector, and λ is the eigenvalue. Eigenvectors are the corresponding vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, result in a scaled version of themselves. These concepts are crucial in understanding the geometry of matrices and are used in various applications, including machine learning and data analysis.
3. **Matrix Operations and Determinants**: Matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, and their determinants can be calculated to understand the solvability of systems of linear equations. The determinant of a matrix can be used to find the inverse of the matrix, and it plays a critical role in various linear algebra applications, including finding the area of a parallelogram and the volume of a parallelepiped.
4. **Systems of Linear Equations and Gaussian Elimination**: Systems of linear equations can be solved using Gaussian elimination, which involves transforming the augmented matrix into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF). This method allows for efficient solving of systems of linear equations and is a fundamental technique in linear algebra.
5. **Linear Independence and Basis**: Linear independence refers to a set of vectors that are not linearly dependent on each other, meaning that none of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space, and it is a crucial concept in understanding the dimensionality and structure of vector spaces.
