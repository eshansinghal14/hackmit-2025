**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. **Derivatives as the Fundamental Measure of Instantaneous Change**  
   - Definition and intuition behind the derivative as the rate of change of a function at a point; essential for interpreting slopes, velocities, and marginal quantities.

2. **Core Differentiation Rules (Power, Product, Quotient, Chain)**  
   - Systematic techniques for computing derivatives of basic algebraic expressions, products of functions, quotients, and composite functions, enabling rapid symbolic differentiation.

3. **The Chain Rule for Composite Functions**  
   - Step‑by‑step method to differentiate nested functions by multiplying outer‑derivative and inner‑derivative; critical for handling functions like \(f(g(x))\).

4. **Implicit Differentiation for Non‑Explicit Relationships**  
   - Procedure to differentiate equations where the dependent variable isn’t isolated, allowing derivative extraction from curves defined implicitly (e.g., \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)).

5. **Related‑Rates Problems Linking Multiple Changing Quantities**  
   - Application of differentiation to situations where several variables change together; solves real‑world scenarios such as moving objects, expanding geometries, and dynamic systems.
