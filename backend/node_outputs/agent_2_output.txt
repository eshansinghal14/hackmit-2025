**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Data Structures**

1. **Linear Data Structures**: Linear data structures, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists, organize data sequentially, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval. These structures are fundamental in programming and are used in various applications, including algorithms and software development.
2. **Data Structure Classification**: Data structures can be broadly classified into two types: linear and non-linear. Linear data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists) organize data sequentially, while non-linear data structures (e.g., trees, graphs) organize data hierarchically or interconnectedly, enabling complex relationships between data elements.
3. **Hash Data Structures**: Hash data structures, such as hash tables and hash maps, enable efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of data elements using keys. These structures are crucial in programming, providing fast data retrieval and manipulation capabilities, with average time complexities of O(1) for read, write, insert, and delete operations.
4. **Tree Data Structures**: Tree data structures, including binary trees and binary search trees, organize data hierarchically, allowing for efficient searching, inserting, and deleting of data elements. Balanced trees, such as AVL trees and red-black trees, ensure a height of O(log n), making read and write operations more efficient.
5. **Algorithmic Complexity**: Understanding algorithmic complexity, including time and space complexity, is essential when working with data structures. This knowledge helps developers analyze and optimize the performance of their algorithms, ensuring efficient use of resources and scalability in various applications.
