**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Gaussian Elimination & System Solving** – Core method for solving linear systems; emphasized in MIT’s 18.06 lectures and reinforced through Hefferon’s extensive problem sets and solution manual.  

2. **Vector Spaces, Subspaces & Linear Maps** – Formal definition of vector spaces, basis, dimension, and linear transformations; presented with geometric intuition in Strang’s videos and developed rigorously in Hefferon’s textbook.  

3. **Determinants & Matrix Properties** – Computation techniques, multilinearity, and the role of determinants in invertibility and volume scaling; covered in both the MIT syllabus and Hefferon’s chapter on determinants.  

4. **Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors & Diagonalization** – Theory of spectral decomposition, similarity transformations, and applications to stability and dynamics; highlighted in MIT’s course topics and reinforced with proofs and exercises in Hefferon’s text.  

5. **Positive‑Definite Matrices & Applications** – Characterization, Cholesky factorization, and use in optimization and statistics; included as a distinct topic in Strang’s curriculum and supported by Hefferon’s applied supplemental sections.
