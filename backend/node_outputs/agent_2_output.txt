**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Gaussian Elimination & System Solving** – Master the step‑by‑step Gauss (row‑reduction) method to solve linear equation systems, compute rank, and determine consistency; reinforced by MIT lecture videos and Hefferon’s extensive problem sets.

2. **Vector Spaces & Linear Transformations** – Understand the definition of vector spaces, subspaces, bases, dimension, and the representation of linear maps as matrices; supported by conceptual explanations in the MIT course and Hefferon’s motivated development.

3. **Determinants & Matrix Invertibility** – Learn determinant computation (cofactor expansion, row‑operations), its geometric interpretation (volume scaling), and its role in testing matrix invertibility and solving systems; both sources provide theory and worked examples.

4. **Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors & Diagonalization** – Study how to find eigenvalues/eigenvectors, the concept of similarity, diagonalization of matrices, and special cases such as positive‑definite matrices; covered in MIT lectures and Hefferon’s chapters with proofs and applications.

5. **Integrated Learning Resources & Computational Practice** – Leverage the full suite of MIT OCW materials (lecture videos, problem sets, exams) together with Hefferon’s free textbook, solution manual, Sage lab manual, and supplemental videos to reinforce theory through hands‑on computation and extensive exercises.
