**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Machine Learning Basics**

1. **Machine Learning Life Cycle** – End‑to‑end workflow covering problem definition, data collection, data preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.  

2. **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Paradigms** – Core categories of algorithms (e.g., classification & regression vs. clustering & dimensionality reduction) with typical use‑cases and evaluation approaches.  

3. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering** – Techniques for loading data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling/normalizing features, and splitting datasets into training/validation/test sets.  

4. **Python Machine‑Learning Toolchain** – Essential libraries and their roles: **NumPy** for numerical operations, **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization, **Scikit‑learn** for classic algorithms, and **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep‑learning models.  

5. **Model Implementation & Evaluation with Scikit‑learn** – Practical steps to instantiate models, fit on training data, make predictions, and assess performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score, ROC‑AUC, and confusion matrices.
