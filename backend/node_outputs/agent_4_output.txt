Let me analyze the assigned sources for Agent 4 (Sites 7-8) to extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes for "basic_calculus".

### Source 7: A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus - BetterExplained

This source provides a conceptual and motivational perspective on calculus rather than technical content. Key insights:

1. **Calculus as an Integrative Framework**: The author describes calculus as something that relates mathematical topics in "an elegant, brain-bending manner" - similar to how Darwin's Theory of Evolution provides a unifying framework for understanding nature. It helps see connections between formulas that might otherwise seem unrelated.

2. **Motivational Approach to Learning**: The source emphasizes that "Math isn't the hard part of math; motivation is." It criticizes conventional math education for focusing too much on "contrived examples, arcane proofs, and memorization" that "body slam our intuition & enthusiasm."

3. **Intuitive Understanding Before Rigor**: The analogy with art education suggests that calculus should be taught with intuitive understanding first (like allowing children to paint before studying paint chemistry), rather than starting with formal proofs and technical details.

4. **Real-World Connections**: The author implies that calculus becomes meaningful when connected to real-world phenomena and intuitive understanding, not just as isolated formulas.

### Source 8: Calculus - Wikipedia

This source provides a more technical overview of calculus as a branch of mathematics. Key insights:

1. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The article prominently features the fundamental theorem of calculus: ∫ₐᵇ f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a), which connects differentiation and integration.

2. **Core Components**: It identifies two main branches:
   - Differential Calculus (concerned with rates of change and slopes of curves)
   - Integral Calculus (concerned with accumulation of quantities and areas under curves)

3. **Key Concepts in Differential Calculus**:
   - Derivatives (with various generalizations)
   - Differentiation notation
   - Rules of differentiation (sum, product, chain, power, quotient, etc.)
   - Applications like related rates, implicit differentiation

4. **Key Concepts in Integral Calculus**:
   - Antiderivatives
   - Integral transforms
   - Leibniz integral rule

5. **Supporting Concepts**:
   - Limits
   - Continuity
   - Rolle's theorem
   - Mean value theorem
   - Inverse function theorem

### Extracting 3-5 Knowledge Nodes

I need to identify 3-5 distinct, specific, and actionable knowledge nodes that are well-supported by these sources. Let me consider what would be most valuable for someone learning basic calculus.

From Source 7, I have more conceptual/motivational insights, while Source 8 provides the technical framework. I should try to balance both aspects.

1. **The Unifying Framework of Calculus** (from Source 7): Understanding how calculus connects different mathematical concepts and provides a cohesive framework for understanding change and accumulation. This is more conceptual but important for motivation.

2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** (from Source 8): The specific mathematical relationship ∫ₐᵇ f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a) that connects differentiation and integration.

3. **Differential vs. Integral Calculus** (from Source 8): Understanding the two main branches of calculus and their respective focuses (rates of change vs. accumulation).

4. **Core Differentiation Rules** (from Source 8): The essential rules for computing derivatives (sum, product, chain, power, quotient).

5. **Intuitive Understanding Before Formalism** (from Source 7): The pedagogical approach that emphasizes developing intuition before diving into rigorous proofs and technical details.

Let me refine these to ensure they're specific, actionable, and well-supported by the sources:

1. **Calculus as an Integrative Mathematical Framework** - Source 7 emphasizes how calculus reveals connections between seemingly unrelated formulas, providing a unifying perspective on mathematics similar to how evolutionary theory provides a unifying framework for biology.

2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** - Source 8 explicitly presents ∫ₐᵇ f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a) as the central relationship connecting differential and integral calculus.

3. **Conceptual Understanding Precedes Technical Mastery** - Source 7 argues that effective calculus education should prioritize intuitive understanding and motivation before formal proofs, comparing the conventional approach to teaching art through paint chemistry before allowing students to create.

4. **Core Differentiation Techniques** - Source 8 lists essential differentiation rules including product rule, chain rule, power rule, and quotient rule as foundational to differential calculus.

5. **Duality of Differential and Integral Calculus** - Source 8 clearly distinguishes between differential calculus (concerned with derivatives, rates of change) and integral calculus (concerned with antiderivatives, accumulation).

Let me check if these nodes are:
- Distinct concepts/techniques/methodologies ✓
- Based strictly on the provided content ✓ 
- Specific and actionable ✓
- Well-supported by the sources ✓

They seem to meet all criteria. I'll present these as the 5 knowledge nodes for Agent 4.

**Agent 4 Knowledge Nodes for: Basic_Calculus**

1. Calculus as an Integrative Mathematical Framework - Understanding how calculus reveals connections between seemingly unrelated mathematical concepts (like circumference, area, and volume formulas), providing a unifying perspective that shows how mathematical ideas interrelate rather than exist in isolation.

2. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - The essential relationship ∫ₐᵇ f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a) that connects differential calculus (rates of change) with integral calculus (accumulation), demonstrating how differentiation and integration are inverse processes.

3. Conceptual Understanding Before Formalism - The pedagogical approach that prioritizes intuitive understanding and real-world relevance before rigorous proofs, recognizing that motivation and engagement are critical to learning calculus effectively.

4. Core Differentiation Rules Framework - Mastering essential differentiation techniques including the product rule, chain rule, power rule, and quotient rule as foundational tools for calculating derivatives across various function types.

5. Differential vs. Integral Calculus Duality - Recognizing the complementary nature of the two main calculus branches: differential calculus (focused on instantaneous rates of change and slopes) and integral calculus (focused on accumulation and areas under curves).
