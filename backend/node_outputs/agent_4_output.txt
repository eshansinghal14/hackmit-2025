**Agent 4 Knowledge Nodes for: Potatoes**

1. **Comprehensive Nutrient Profile & Core Health Benefits**  
   - Potatoes deliver ~45 % DV vitamin C, 620 mg potassium (more than a banana), 10 % DV B6, and measurable amounts of thiamine, riboflavin, folate, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc—all within ≈ 110 kcal and **zero fat, sodium, or cholesterol**.  
   - The flesh supplies most vitamin C and potassium; the skin provides the bulk of dietary fiber and additional antioxidants (carotenoids, anthocyanins).  
   - As a **complex carbohydrate**, potatoes supply steady energy without triggering the “carb‑spike” myth, supporting muscle performance and brain function.

2. **Safe Selection, Storage, and Prep Practices**  
   - **Selection:** Choose firm, smooth‑skinned tubers with few shallow eyes; avoid green‑tinged, sprouted, or soft spots.  
   - **Storage:** Keep in a cool, dark, well‑ventilated area (burlap, brown paper, or perforated plastic) – not refrigerated – to prevent sprouting and greening.  
   - **Preparation:** Scrub, remove deep eyes/sprouts/green areas, and cook by boiling, baking, steaming, microwaving, grilling, or frying. Removing green spots and sprouts eliminates solanine (the toxin that forms when potatoes turn green).  

3. **Integrating Potatoes into Balanced Diets & Weight‑Loss Plans**  
   - One medium (150 g) skin‑on potato counts as **1 cup of starchy vegetables** and satisfies a vegetable serving.  
   - Pair with low‑fat toppings (salsa, Greek yogurt, steamed veggies) or mash with low‑fat broth to keep calories low while boosting satiety.  
   - Including potatoes increases overall diet quality by adding potassium, fiber, and vitamin C, and can support weight‑loss when total caloric intake is managed.

4. **Cultivar Choice & Home‑Garden Production Guidelines**  
   - **Cultivar selection** (red‑skinned, white‑skinned, russet) should match climate, soil, and intended culinary use.  
   - **Planting & care:** Seed tubers are planted after soil warms; apply balanced fertilizer, ensure consistent irrigation, and monitor for common pests (e.g., Colorado potato beetle).  
   - **Harvest & storage** timing influences nutrient retention; harvest when vines die back, cure in a dark, ventilated space before long‑term storage.

5. **Versatile Culinary Applications & Recipe Development**  
   - Core methods: baked, microwave‑baked, roasted (olive oil, garlic, herbs), onion‑roasted, oven fries, rosemary‑roasted, grilled skewers, and “potato packets” for outdoor cooking.  
   - Emphasize **skin‑on** preparations to preserve fiber and antioxidants.  
   - Example actionable recipe: *Roasted Potato Wedges* – toss cubed potatoes with 1 Tbsp olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary, and sea salt; roast at 220 °C for 25 min, turning halfway. This yields a nutrient‑dense side dish suitable for meal planning.
