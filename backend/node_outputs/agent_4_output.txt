I need to analyze only the research sources assigned to me (Agent 4 of 5), which are Source 7: "A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus - BetterExplained" and Source 8: "Calculus - Wikipedia". I need to extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from these sources, with each node being a distinct concept, technique, or methodology.

Let me carefully analyze what's in these sources:

### Source 7: A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus - BetterExplained

Key points from this source:
1. Calculus relates mathematical topics in an elegant way - it provides connections between formulas that seem unrelated when learned independently.
2. The article compares calculus to Darwin's Theory of Evolution in terms of how it provides a unifying framework for understanding concepts.
3. It argues that calculus education often fails by focusing on contrived examples, arcane proofs, and memorization that damages intuition.
4. The source emphasizes that motivation is the real challenge in learning math, not the math itself.
5. It critiques traditional math education as being disconnected from intuitive understanding and real-world application.
6. There's an analogy comparing traditional math education to teaching art by only focusing on paint chemistry, physics of light, and eye anatomy without letting students actually create art.

### Source 8: Calculus - Wikipedia

This appears to be a Wikipedia entry about calculus. From the truncated content, I can see:
1. The fundamental theorem of calculus: ∫_a^b f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a)
2. Major branches: Differential calculus and Integral calculus
3. Concepts related to differential calculus:
   - Derivatives (with generalizations)
   - Differentiation notation
   - Second derivative
   - Implicit differentiation
   - Logarithmic differentiation
   - Related rates
   - Taylor's theorem
4. Rules and identities for differentiation:
   - Sum rule
   - Product rule
   - Chain rule
   - Power rule
   - Quotient rule
   - L'Hôpital's rule
   - Inverse function rule
   - General Leibniz rule
   - Faà di Bruno's formula
   - Reynolds rule
5. Concepts related to integral calculus:
   - Antiderivative
   - Integral transforms
   - Leibniz integral rule
   - Lists of integrals

Now I need to extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from these sources. Each node should be distinct, specific, actionable, and well-supported by the content.

Let me identify potential knowledge nodes:

From Source 7:
1. Conceptual understanding approach to calculus - viewing calculus as a unifying framework that connects seemingly disparate mathematical formulas
2. Motivation-centered calculus education - addressing the motivational challenges in learning calculus rather than focusing solely on technical aspects
3. Intuition-based learning methodology - avoiding contrived examples and focusing on building intuitive understanding

From Source 8:
1. Fundamental theorem of calculus - the relationship between differentiation and integration expressed as ∫_a^b f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a)
2. Differentiation rules - including product rule, chain rule, quotient rule, etc.
3. Integral calculus concepts - including antiderivatives and integration techniques

Now I need to refine these into 3-5 distinct, specific, actionable knowledge nodes that span both sources but don't duplicate what other agents might cover (since I only have access to sources 7-8 out of 8 total).

Let me craft the final knowledge nodes:

1. **Calculus as a Unifying Framework** - From Source 7, this node emphasizes how calculus connects seemingly unrelated mathematical formulas (like circumference, area, and volume of circles/spheres) into a coherent system. This is actionable by encouraging students to look for connections between concepts rather than memorizing formulas in isolation.

2. **Motivational Approach to Calculus Education** - From Source 7, this node addresses the importance of maintaining student motivation by focusing on intuitive understanding and real-world relevance rather than dry memorization. It's actionable through specific teaching strategies that prioritize engagement.

3. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** - From Source 8, this is the core relationship between differentiation and integration expressed as ∫_a^b f'(t)dt = f(b) - f(a). This is highly specific and actionable as it forms the basis for solving many calculus problems.

4. **Key Differentiation Rules and Applications** - From Source 8, this node covers essential rules (product, chain, quotient) and applications (related rates, implicit differentiation). It's actionable through problem-solving techniques.

5. **Intuition-Based Learning Methodology** - From Source 7, this node advocates for building calculus understanding through intuitive approaches rather than starting with technical formalism. It's actionable through specific learning strategies that prioritize conceptual understanding.

Let me check if these are:
- Distinct concepts: Yes, each focuses on a different aspect
- Based strictly on the content: Yes
- Specific and actionable: Yes
- Well-supported: Yes, each has clear references in the sources
- Covering both foundational and advanced concepts: Yes (fundamental theorem is foundational, while specific rules/applications are more advanced)

I think these 5 nodes capture the most important concepts from my assigned sources while being specific and actionable.

Let me review once more to make sure I'm not including concepts from sources I didn't analyze:

1. Calculus as a Unifying Framework - Directly from Source 7's discussion of how calculus connects formulas
2. Motivational Approach to Calculus Education - Directly from Source 7's critique of traditional math education
3. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Clearly stated in Source 8
4. Key Differentiation Rules and Applications - Listed in Source 8
5. Intuition-Based Learning Methodology - From Source 7's emphasis on intuition over contrived examples

Yes, these all come directly from my assigned sources.
