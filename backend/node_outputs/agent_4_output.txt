Let me analyze the information provided for Agent 4 and extract key knowledge nodes from the assigned sources.

Agent 4 is assigned to analyze Sources 7 and 8 for "basic_calculus".

Let's examine each source:

### Source 7: Basic Calculus Types, Formulas & Rules - Lesson - Study.com
The content for this source only says: "In order to continue enjoying our site, we ask that you confirm your identity as a human. Thank you very much for your cooperation."

This appears to be a placeholder message or a CAPTCHA prompt rather than actual content about calculus. There is no substantive information about calculus in this source that I can extract for knowledge nodes.

### Source 8: Calculus I - Review
This source appears to be from a Calculus I review chapter, likely from Lamar University's math website (tutorial.math.lamar.edu). The content describes:

1. The importance of algebra and trigonometry skills for success in Calculus
2. How many students enter Calculus unprepared for the algebra and trigonometry required
3. How weak algebra/trig skills become the biggest impediment to learning calculus concepts
4. The purpose of the review chapter is to cover topics that students are "particularly deficient in"
5. It mentions that factoring, solving linear and quadratic equations are assumed knowledge

The content appears to be truncated, but from what's provided, I can extract some key concepts about the foundational skills needed for calculus.

From Source 8, I can identify these potential knowledge nodes:

1. **Algebra Prerequisite Mastery** - The text emphasizes that strong algebra skills are "absolutely vital" to successfully completing calculus. It specifically mentions that students often struggle with the algebra in calculus problems rather than the calculus concepts themselves.

2. **Trigonometry Prerequisite Integration** - The text states that good trig skills are important in many calculus sections, indicating that trigonometry is not just a prerequisite but actively integrated throughout calculus.

3. **Common Student Deficiencies Awareness** - The review chapter targets topics that "most students are particularly deficient in," suggesting there are specific areas where calculus students typically need reinforcement.

4. **Self-Assessment of Foundational Knowledge** - The text implies students should evaluate their own algebra and trig skills before diving into calculus concepts, as these foundational skills are assumed knowledge.

Let me check if there are any other specific concepts mentioned. The text mentions that factoring, linear equations, and quadratic equations are assumed knowledge but doesn't go into detail about them since they're not covered in this review chapter.

Since Source 7 provided no usable content, all my knowledge nodes will come from Source 8. I need to create 3-5 nodes that are specific, actionable, and based strictly on the content provided.

Let me refine these into proper knowledge nodes:

1. **Algebra Skill Assessment for Calculus Readiness** - The necessity of evaluating one's algebra skills before beginning calculus, as weak algebra skills become the primary obstacle to understanding calculus concepts rather than the calculus itself.

2. **Trigonometry Integration in Calculus Problems** - Understanding how trigonometric concepts are woven throughout calculus problems and why proficiency in trigonometry is essential for success in calculus courses that include trigonometric functions.

3. **Targeted Review of Common Deficiency Areas** - Focusing study efforts on the specific algebra and trigonometry topics that calculus students are typically weakest in, as identified by experienced calculus instructors.

4. **Conceptual vs. Computational Struggle Identification** - Recognizing when difficulties in calculus problems stem from lack of understanding calculus concepts versus struggling with the underlying algebra/trigonometry computations.

5. **Prerequisite Knowledge Self-Diagnosis** - Developing the ability to self-identify gaps in prerequisite knowledge (algebra and trigonometry) that could impede calculus learning.

Let me check if these nodes are:
- Distinct concepts, techniques, or methodologies ✓
- Based strictly on the content provided ✓
- The most important and well-supported concepts ✓
- Specific and actionable ✓
- Including both foundational and advanced concepts where present ✓

Source 8 doesn't provide specific advanced calculus concepts, as it's focused on prerequisites. All the nodes I've identified are foundational to calculus success.

I'll select the 3-5 most important nodes based on the emphasis in the source:

1. **Algebra Skill Assessment for Calculus Readiness**
2. **Trigonometry Integration in Calculus Problems**
3. **Targeted Review of Common Deficiency Areas**
4. **Conceptual vs. Computational Struggle Identification**

These four nodes seem to capture the most important concepts from Source 8. Source 7 provided no usable content, so I won't include any nodes from it.

Let me make sure these nodes are actionable and specific:

1. **Algebra Skill Assessment for Calculus Readiness** - This is actionable because it suggests students should assess their algebra skills before starting calculus. It's specific about how weak algebra skills become the primary obstacle.

2. **Trigonometry Integration in Calculus Problems** - This is actionable as it directs attention to trigonometry proficiency. It's specific about trigonometry being "important in many sections" of calculus.

3. **Targeted Review of Common Deficiency Areas** - This is actionable by suggesting focused review of specific problem areas. It's specific about these being topics "most students are particularly deficient in."

4. **Conceptual vs. Computational Struggle Identification** - This is actionable by helping students diagnose where their difficulties lie. It's specific about students "struggling with the algebra and trig in the problems rather than working to understand the calculus topics."

These nodes seem to meet all the criteria. I'll format them as requested.
