**Agent 4 Knowledge Nodes for: Python Programming**

1. **Progressive Learning Roadmap – From Syntax to Portfolio**  
   *Combine introductory tutorials (print, basic arithmetic, strings) → hands‑on mini‑projects → a curated portfolio that showcases real‑world Python applications.*  

2. **Fundamental Language Building Blocks**  
   *Core syntax, data types, and structures (numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, file I/O, lambda expressions) plus common built‑in functions and exception handling.*  

3. **Object‑Oriented Programming & Multi‑Paradigm Mastery**  
   *Understanding classes, inheritance, `type()` vs `isinstance()`, and Python’s support for procedural, functional, and reflective styles.*  

4. **Domain‑Specific Libraries & Frameworks**  
   *Data science stack (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit‑learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch), web development (Flask, Django), game development (Pygame, Kivy), robotics (Raspberry Pi), and emerging areas (Qiskit for quantum computing).*  

5. **Career‑Ready Practices – Projects, Portfolio, and Hiring Insight**  
   *Structured project work, building a public portfolio, and applying insider hiring‑manager tips (e.g., showcasing OOP, web, and data‑science projects) to improve employability.*
