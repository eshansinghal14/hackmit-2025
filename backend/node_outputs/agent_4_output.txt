Now, I need to identify 3-5 key knowledge nodes that are distinct, specific, actionable, and well-supported by these sources. I should focus on the most important concepts that appear in these specific sources.

Let me evaluate which concepts are most prominent and valuable:

1. **Null Space and Column Space**: These are clearly defined in Source 8 and appear to be fundamental concepts. The source explains their mathematical definitions and significance.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Mentioned prominently in Source 8 with both theoretical and computational aspects covered. Also, SVD has significant applications in data science (as implied by Source 7).

3. **Practical Applications in Data Science and AI**: Source 7 emphasizes real-world applications across industries and specifically in data science/AI fields like recommendation systems, neural networks, etc.

7. **Linear Algebra Roadmap for Data Science**: Source 7 specifically mentions a roadmap for linear algebra in 2024 focused on data science and AI applications.

Let me consider which of these would make the best knowledge nodes:

1. **Null Space and Column Space** - This is a strong candidate as it's well-defined in Source 8 and fundamental to understanding linear systems.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Applications** - This appears in both sources implicitly (Source 7 mentions applications in data science, Source 8 covers the theory).

3. **Real-World Applications of Linear Algebra in Data Science and AI** - This is a major theme in Source 7 and connects theory to practice.

4. **Matrix Norms and Their Equivalence** - Well-defined in Source 8, but may be too foundational compared to other concepts.

5. **Projection Techniques for Data Transformation** - Mentioned in Source 8, with practical applications.

6. **Sherman-Morrison Formula for Efficient Matrix Operations** - A specific advanced technique from Source 8.

I need to select 3-5 nodes that best represent the unique content of these sources. Let me consider how distinctive and actionable each node is:

1. **Null Space and Column Space Analysis** - Very specific, well-defined in Source 8, and critical for understanding linear systems.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in Machine Learning** - This appears to bridge both sources - theoretical in Source 8 and practical applications in Source 7.

3. **Practical Linear Algebra Roadmap for Data Science Professionals** - Source 7 specifically mentions this roadmap, which seems to be a structured approach to learning linear algebra for data science.

4. **Sherman-Morrison Formula for Matrix Inversion Optimization** - A specific computational technique from Source 8 that would be valuable for practitioners.

5. **Vector Projection Methods for Dimensionality Reduction** - Mentioned in Source 8 and has clear applications in data science.

Let me refine these to be more specific and actionable:

1. **Null Space and Column Space Applications in Solving Linear Systems** - Focusing on how these concepts help determine solution existence and uniqueness.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition Implementation in Machine Learning Algorithms** - Highlighting both the theoretical foundation and practical implementation.

3. **Targeted Linear Algebra Learning Pathway for Data Science Practitioners** - Based on Source 7's roadmap concept.

4. **Sherman-Morrison Formula for Efficient Matrix Updates** - Focusing on the practical computational advantage.

5. **Vector Projection Techniques for Data Transformation** - Emphasizing practical applications.

I think these 5 nodes capture the most important and distinctive content from the assigned sources. Let me check if they are well-supported by the sources:

1. Null Space and Column Space: Strongly supported by Source 8 with clear definitions and explanations.
2. SVD: Supported by Source 8's detailed coverage and implied by Source 7's focus on practical applications.
3. Learning Pathway: Explicitly mentioned in Source 7 as "Linear Algebra RoadMap 2024".
4. Sherman-Morrison: Explicitly covered in Source 8.
5. Vector Projection: Explicitly mentioned in Source 8's table of contents.

All of these nodes are specific, actionable, and well-supported by the assigned sources. They include both foundational concepts (Null Space, Column Space) and more advanced applications (SVD, Sherman-Morrison).

Let me formulate the final knowledge nodes:

1. **Null Space and Column Space Analysis for System Solvability**
2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Implementation in Machine Learning**
3. **Practical Linear Algebra Roadmap for Data Science Professionals**
4. **Sherman-Morrison Formula for Efficient Matrix Inversion Updates**

**Agent 4 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Null Space and Column Space Analysis for Linear System Solvability**  
   Understanding the null space $\mathcal{N}(A) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid Ax = 0 \}$ and column space determines whether systems $Ax = b$ have solutions. When columns of $A$ are linearly independent, the null space contains only the zero vector, ensuring unique solutions. This analysis is critical for determining feasibility in optimization problems and machine learning applications.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Implementation in Machine Learning**  
   SVD decomposes any matrix into three components ($U\Sigma V^T$) that reveal its fundamental structure. This technique powers dimensionality reduction, noise filtering, and latent factor analysis in recommendation systems, computer vision, and natural language processing. Understanding both the theoretical foundation and computational implementation of SVD enables practitioners to apply it effectively to real-world data problems.

3. **Practical Linear Algebra Roadmap for Data Science Professionals**  
   A targeted learning pathway focusing on concepts actually used in data science and AI (2024 update), eliminating unnecessary theoretical depth. This roadmap prioritizes immediately applicable skills like vector operations, matrix transformations, and eigenvalue problems that directly support building recommendation systems, training neural networks, and analyzing medical images without requiring mastery of entire mathematics textbooks.

4. **Sherman-Morrison Formula for Efficient Matrix Updates**  
   This specialized technique allows for computationally efficient updates to matrix inverses when minor changes occur ($ (A+uv^T)^{-1} $), avoiding expensive full recomputation. Particularly valuable in iterative machine learning algorithms and real-time systems where matrices are frequently updated with small changes, this formula significantly improves computational efficiency in production environments.

5. **Vector Projection Techniques for Data Transformation**  
   Projection of vectors onto other vectors or subspaces enables dimensionality reduction, noise removal, and feature extraction. These techniques form the mathematical foundation for principal component analysis (PCA) and other transformation methods essential in preprocessing data for machine learning models, allowing practitioners to extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional datasets.
