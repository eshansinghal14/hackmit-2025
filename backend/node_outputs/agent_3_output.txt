Okay, let me start by going through the assigned sources from 21 to 30. My job is to extract key knowledge nodes from these. I need to make sure I cover the most important and well-supported concepts without overlapping with other agents. Let's take it step by step.

First, Source 21 is the MIT OpenCourseWare for Linear Algebra. It mentions topics like systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, and positive definite matrices. The course emphasizes foundational and practical topics, so concepts here are probably core. Important nodes could be vector spaces, eigenvalues, and systems of equations.

Source 22 is a GitHub page explaining linear algebra concepts. It goes into null space, column space, projection, Gram-Schmidt, solving systems, SVD, Sherman-Morrison, and others. The outer product, inner product, and matrix rank are mentioned. Null space and column space are fundamental here. SVD is a more advanced topic, so that should be a node. Also, the concept of matrix rank is crucial.

Source 23 is a video from 3blue1brown on vectors. While the content is visual, the key takeaways are understanding vectors and their geometric interpretation. This might tie into vector spaces and linear transformations, but since it's introductory, maybe the main point is the geometric intuition behind vectors and linear transformations.

Source 24 is a table of contents for a linear algebra textbook. It lists chapters like vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices, determinants, basis, dimension, eigenvalues, diagonalization, orthonormal bases, and more. These are all standard topics, so nodes here could be linear transformations, basis and dimension, and diagonalization.

Source 25 is the preface of the textbook. It emphasizes vector spaces and linear transformations as structures to model real-world problems. The importance of Gaussian elimination and diagonalization is highlighted. The main idea here is the application of linear algebra in modeling and solving problems.

Source 26 is Klotz's online notes. It covers vector spaces, subspaces, linear systems, linear independence, basis, linear transformations, matrix representation, composition of transformations, isomorphisms, and more. Key nodes here might be linear independence, matrix representation of transformations, and isomorphisms.

Source 27 is a LibreTexts chapter on what linear algebra is. It defines vectors, linear functions, matrices. The takeaway is that linear algebra studies vectors and linear transformations. Important concepts include the definition of vectors and linear functions, and the role of matrices as linear functions.

Source 28 is a Wiingy article explaining linear algebra. It mentions topics like linear equations, matrices, vectors, and their applications in engineering and physics. The focus is on the three main areas: linear equations, matrices, vectors. This might reinforce the importance of systems of linear equations and matrix operations.

Source 29 is a question set with solutions on matrices. It includes topics like matrix transpose, inverse, determinants, eigenvalues, and row operations. The key here is the computational techniques for matrices and solving linear systems.

Source 30 is a chapter from a machine learning book. It starts with scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors, and their applications in machine learning. It mentions the importance of vectors and matrices for deep learning. This could highlight the use of vectors in machine learning contexts, but since it's part of a machine learning book, maybe the main nodes are the definitions of vectors, matrices, and tensors.

Now, compiling all these, I need to identify the most important and distinct concepts. Let's see:

1. **Null Space and Column Space**: Both are fundamental in understanding solutions to linear systems, mentioned in Source 22 and Source 24.
2. **Matrix Rank and Linear Independence**: Crucial for understanding the structure of matrices and vector spaces (Sources 22, 26).
3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Core concepts in linear algebra with wide applications, covered in multiple sources (21, 24, 25).
4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: An advanced technique with significant applications in data science (Source 22).
5. **Linear Transformations and Their Matrix Representation**: Central to the study of linear algebra (Sources 24, 26, 27).

These nodes cover both foundational and advanced topics across the sources assigned. They are distinct and supported by the content given. I should check if any of these overlap with other agents' areas, but since each agent has a different set of sources, and I've focused on my assigned ones, this should be okay.

**Agent 3 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Null Space and Column Space Analysis**  
   - Core concepts for understanding solutions to linear systems. The null space (N(A)) represents vectors mapped to zero by matrix A, while the column space (range) determines solvability of Ax = b. Foundational for analyzing matrix behavior in systems of equations.

2. **Matrix Rank and Linear Independence**  
   - Rank defines the maximum number of linearly independent rows/columns in a matrix, critical for determining solutions to linear systems. Linear independence ensures vectors in a set cannot be expressed as combinations of others, central to basis and dimension concepts.

3. **Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Diagonalization**  
   - Eigenvalues (λ) and eigenvectors (v) satisfy Av = λv, revealing intrinsic properties of matrices. Diagonalization (A = PDP⁻¹) simplifies computations and is pivotal in applications like stability analysis and differential equations.

4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
   - A matrix factorization method (A = UΣVᵀ) decomposing matrices into orthogonal and diagonal components. Used in data compression, principal component analysis, and solving ill-conditioned systems.

5. **Linear Transformations and Matrix Representation**  
   - Linear transformations map vectors between spaces while preserving structure (T(av + bw) = aT(v) + bT(w)). Matrices represent these transformations, enabling computational modeling in geometry, physics, and machine learning.
