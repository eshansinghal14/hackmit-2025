Alright, let me start by looking at the research sources assigned to Agent 3. There are 10 sources from 21 to 30. My task is to extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from these sources. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology based on the content provided. I need to make sure I focus on the most important and well-supported concepts, both foundational and advanced if present.

First, I'll go through each source one by one and note down the key points. Let's start with Source 21: Learn Python Programming Language. The content mentions Python's simplicity and gentle learning curve, making it a good first language. It also lists topics like Python basics, operators, loops, functions, strings, files, closures, and interview questions. The emphasis here is on Python's readability and ease of use for beginners.

Moving to Source 22: Python Tutorials for Beginners. It highlights Python as a versatile, interpreted, and open-source language. The example code for "Hello World!" shows how straightforward Python syntax is. The source also mentions Python's dynamic typing and automatic memory management, which are important for beginners. The mention of "batteries included" refers to the extensive standard libraries.

Source 23: Python - Introduction | Introduction to Software Systems. This one talks about Python's key features like readability, versatility, being an interpreted language, and having extensive libraries. Applications in web development, data science, automation, and scientific computing are highlighted. The basic example of "Hello, World!" and the installation instructions are also present here.

Source 24: Python Overview. It discusses Python's characteristics such as being an interpreted, object-oriented, and interactive language. The example of adding two numbers is given, showing the simplicity. It also covers Python's origins, versions (2.0 and 3.0), and its use in Google. The fact that Python is open-source and cross-platform is mentioned here.

Source 25: Python Full Course Online. This source outlines a comprehensive course structure covering basics, data types, OOP concepts, and practical exercises. The course is for beginners to advanced, emphasizing hands-on projects and problem-solving. It mentions key topics like variables, functions, modules, and file handling.

Source 26: Google's Python Class. This is a free class for those with some programming experience to learn Python. The focus is on practical coding exercises, starting with basic concepts like strings and lists and moving to more complex programs. The class is designed to build up to full programs dealing with text files and HTTP connections.

Source 27: Art of Problem Solving. The content here is about learning Python basics, including booleans, control flow, and programming examples. It recommends reading a getting started guide first and emphasizes learning through examples. The example programs are part of the learning process.

Source 28: Learn Python Programming - Python Tutorial. This source provides a detailed table of contents covering topics from variables, strings, control structures to OOP and advanced topics like virtual environments and regular expressions. The emphasis is on practical coding examples and exercises.

Source 29: School of Computing - Learning Python. The content is structured into modules covering computers and programs, input/output, data types, and more. It includes a software development process, variables, expressions, and programming exercises. The focus is on step-by-step learning with examples.

Source 30: Online Python Developer from Southwestern College. This seems to be a course listing, but the content is mostly login and contact information. It mentions Python language training but doesn't provide specific technical content, so maybe not as useful for knowledge nodes.

Now, compiling the key concepts from these sources. The main themes I notice are Python's simplicity and readability, its versatility in various domains (web dev, data science, automation), the importance of hands-on practice with examples and projects, the use of OOP and functional programming paradigms, and the availability of extensive libraries and frameworks. Also, the role of Python as an interpreted language with dynamic typing and automatic memory management is mentioned in multiple sources.

I need to ensure that the nodes are distinct. Let me check for overlaps. Python's simplicity is mentioned in several places. The use of OOP is covered in Source 21 (functions,losures, interview questions) and Source 29 (modules, inheritance). The importance of libraries is in Source 22 and 23. Hands-on projects are in Sources 25 and 26. The interpreted nature and dynamic typing are in 22, 24.

So, possible nodes could be:

1. Python's Readability and Simplicity as a Beginner-Friendly Language
2. Utilization of Python's Extensive Standard Library and Third-Party Frameworks
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python
4. Practical Application of Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals)
5. Hands-On Project-Based Learning for Advanced Python Skills

I need to verify if these concepts are well-supported in the sources. Source 21, 22, 23, 24 all mention Python's simplicity and readability. The standard libraries are mentioned in 22 and 23. OOP is covered in 21, 25, 28, 29. Control structures (loops, conditionals) are in 21, 22, 27, 28, 29. Project-based learning is in 25 and 26. That seems solid. Each node is distinct and covers different aspects from the sources.

**Agent 3 Knowledge Nodes for: Python Programming**

1. **Python's Readability and Simplicity as a Beginner-Friendly Language**  
   Python’s English-like syntax and minimalistic design reduce the learning curve, making it ideal for first-time programmers. Sources emphasize its focus on code clarity, dynamic typing, and automatic memory management (Sources 21, 22, 23, 24).

2. **Utilization of Python’s Extensive Standard Library and Third-Party Frameworks**  
   Python’s “batteries-included” philosophy provides robust built-in modules (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `math`) and popular third-party frameworks (e.g., Django, NumPy, Pandas) for tasks like web development, data science, and automation (Sources 22, 23, 28).

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python**  
   Python supports OOP through classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Key topics include constructors, getters/setters, modules, and static methods, as outlined in practical tutorials (Sources 21, 25, 28, 29).

4. **Practical Application of Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals)**  
   Foundational programming constructs like `for` loops, `while` loops, `if-else` statements, and nested logic are universally emphasized, with examples for tasks like list iteration and decision-making (Sources 21, 22, 27, 28, 29).

5. **Hands-On Project-Based Learning for Advanced Python Skills**  
   Advanced proficiency is achieved through real-world projects (e.g., file handling, web scraping, automation) and coding challenges, as highlighted in structured courses and Google’s Python class (Sources 25, 26, 28).
