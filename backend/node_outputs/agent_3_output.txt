Okay, so I need to extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from the assigned sources (21-30) for Data Structures. Let me start by reviewing each source to identify the main points. 

Source 21 from Tutorialspoint covers basics of data structures, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and searching algorithms like linear and binary search. It also mentions hash tables. The key concepts here might be the basic data structures and their implementations, like arrays and linked lists.

Source 22 by Techgeekbuzz talks about data structure basics, algorithms (greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming), arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and searching techniques. The emphasis here is on different algorithm types and their applications with specific data structures.

Source 23 from GeeksforGeeks lists various data structures and their applications. It mentions classifications like linear (arrays, linked lists) and non-linear (trees, graphs), and includes advanced structures like B-trees and hash tables. The article also discusses the importance of choosing the right structure for applications.

Source 24 is Open Data Structures in pseudocode. It outlines chapters on array-based lists, linked lists, skiplists, hash tables, binary trees, red-black trees, heaps, sorting algorithms, graphs, and integer data structures. The focus here is on both basic and advanced structures with pseudocode examples.

Source 25 from CS-Fundamentals introduces basic and advanced data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, dictionaries, hash tables, and graphs. It also mentions ADT (Abstract Data Types) and their importance in design.

Source 26 on Wikipedia defines data structures, their role in organizing data, and mentions abstract data types (ADT). It also notes that different structures are suited for different applications, like B-trees in databases and hash tables in compilers.

Source 27 from IBM explains data structures as a way to format data for efficient use, giving examples like arrays. It highlights the importance in programming, algorithms, and applications like databases and machine learning.

Source 28 from The Data Structures Handbook discusses the importance of choosing the right structure based on data relationships and efficiency. It explains ADTs and common operations like access, insertion, deletion.

Source 29 is a cheat sheet with diagrams and complexity charts for data structures. It's a resource for quick reference but doesn't add new concepts beyond what's in the other sources.

Source 30 from LINFO defines data structures, their efficiency, and types like linear and non-linear. It mentions B-trees, linked lists, and how structures are formed from basic components like arrays and references.

Now, compiling the key points. The basics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues are covered in multiple sources. ADT is mentioned in sources 25, 26, and 28. Advanced structures like B-trees, red-black trees, and skiplists are in sources 23, 24, 30. Algorithm types (greedy, divide and conquer) are in source 22. The importance of choosing the right structure for applications and efficiency (like in source 26 and 27) is a recurring theme. Also, the concept of time and space complexity is present in sources like 24 and 29.

The main nodes should cover foundational structures, ADT, advanced structures, algorithm integration, and application-specific choices. I need to make sure each node is distinct and well-supported by the sources. Avoid overlaps between agents' topics. For example, Agent 2 might have covered trees and graphs, so I should focus on other advanced structures or other aspects like ADT and algorithm types.

**Agent 3 Knowledge Nodes for: Data Structures**

1. **Abstract Data Types (ADT) and Their Role in Design**  
   - ADTs define logical behavior of data structures (e.g., stack operations like push/pop) without specifying implementation details, enabling abstraction for efficient programming.  
   - Supported by sources 25, 26, and 28, which emphasize ADTs as a bridge between theoretical design and practical implementation.

2. **Advanced Data Structures for Specialized Applications**  
   - Structures like **B-trees** (used in databases), **Red-Black Trees** (self-balancing for dynamic data), **Skiplists** (for faster search in linked lists), and **Hash Tables** (for fast lookups) are critical for optimizing performance in specific domains.  
   - Highlighted in sources 23, 24, and 30, which link these structures to real-world use cases like compilers, filesystems, and databases.

3. **Algorithm-Data Structure Integration for Efficiency**  
   - Pairing data structures with algorithms (e.g., binary search with sorted arrays, hashing for collision resolution) ensures optimal time and space complexity.  
   - Source 21 (binary search, hashing) and source 22 (divide-and-conquer with recursion) demonstrate how algorithmic choices depend on underlying data organization.

4. **Linear vs. Non-Linear Data Structure Classifications**  
   - **Linear structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) organize data sequentially, while **non-linear structures** (trees, graphs) model hierarchical or interconnected relationships.  
   - Source 23 and 30 detail these classifications, stressing their applicability to problems like network routing (graphs) or hierarchical storage (trees).

5. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Selection**  
   - Choosing the right structure (e.g., linked lists for dynamic insertion vs. arrays for random access) requires evaluating trade-offs in time (O(n), O(log n)) and space (static vs. dynamic memory use).  
   - Source 24’s complexity tables and source 27’s emphasis on efficiency in code performance underscore this decision-making process.
