Okay, let's tackle this. I need to generate 3-5 key knowledge nodes for Agent 3 based on the assigned sources 21-30. First, I'll go through each source and identify the main points.

Starting with Source 21: It discusses whether potatoes are healthy. The key points here are that potatoes are starchy vegetables but still nutritious. They contain potassium, vitamin C, and fiber. Also, the skin is important for nutrients. There's mention of different potato types like Russet, Red, etc., but the differences in nutrition are small. Cooking methods matter for health.

Source 22: This seems to be a bit more about promoting potatoes as a nutritional staple, maybe a different angle. But the content is truncated, so I can't see much. Maybe it talks about using potatoes as a base for meals or their role in a diet.

Source 23: A recipe for roasted potatoes. Key info here is the cooking method, ingredients like olive oil and herbs, and the nutrition facts. It's a practical application of how to prepare potatoes healthily.

Source 24: Focuses on types of potatoes. Lists different varieties (Russet, Red, White, Yellow, Purple, Fingerling, Petite) and their uses. Each type has different characteristics. Also mentions that sweet potatoes are different. This is about selecting the right potato for the right dish.

Source 25: From Philippines, talks about how potatoes grow, sustainability, and compares white vs. sweet potatoes. Also mentions diabetes and glycemic index. Safety tips about pesticides. Truncated, but the main points are about growing and dietary considerations.

Source 26: Tips on preparing and preserving potatoes. Recipes like baked potatoes, oven fries, mashed potatoes. Also mentions safety in cooking and storage. Emphasizes the nutritional value and how toppings can affect it.

Source 27: How potatoes are grown, especially in Washington. Details on planting, irrigation, disease management, fertilization. This is about agricultural practices, which might be more advanced.

Source 28: Nutrition facts, emphasizing potassium, fiber, antioxidants. Russet potatoes rank high in antioxidants. Vitamin C content and protein. This is a key node on nutritional benefits.

Source 29: Growing potatoes in New Zealand. Steps for planting, timing, soil preparation, fertilization. Different varieties suitable for the region. Practical for gardening.

Source 30: Discusses potatoes as a superfood, complex carbs, and their role in a balanced diet. Debunking myths about them being unhealthy. Cooking methods affect nutritional value.

Now, compiling the key concepts:

1. Potatoes as Starchy Vegetables with Nutritional Value: From Source 21, they are starchy but still have vitamins and minerals like potassium, vitamin C, and B6. The skin is important for fiber.

2. Cooking Methods for Health: Source 21 and 23 mention that cooking methods matter. Roasting with minimal oil and herbs is healthier than frying. Also, Source 28 notes that cooking in skin retains nutrients.

3. Potato Varieties and Their Uses: Source 24 and 29 list different types (Russet, Red, etc.) and their best uses in cooking. Sweet potatoes are different in nutrition.

4. Nutritional Benefits of Potatoes: Source 28 highlights potassium, fiber, antioxidants, and vitamin C. They are a good source of these nutrients, even compared to other foods.

5. Growing Techniques for Potatoes: Source 27 and 29 discuss planting methods, irrigation, and disease management. Important for farmers or gardeners.

I need to make sure these are distinct and actionable. Also, check if any nodes overlap. For example, nutritional benefits and cooking methods are separate but related. Growing techniques are more about agriculture, which might be another node. The varieties and their uses is about selection, which is practical.

**Agent 3 Knowledge Nodes for: Potatoes**  

1. **Potatoes as Starchy Vegetables with High Nutritional Value**  
   - Potatoes are classified as starchy vegetables due to their carb content but remain nutrient-dense. A medium russet potato provides 25% of daily potassium, 35% of vitamin C, 30% of vitamin B6, and 4g of fiber (skin included). The skin contributes half the fiber and key nutrients like potassium. While higher in calories than non-starchy vegetables, they align with dietary guidelines when consumed in moderation (e.g., 5 cups/week for 2,000-calorie diets).  

2. **Optimal Cooking Methods for Nutrient Retention**  
   - Baking, roasting, or boiling potatoes in their skin preserves water-soluble vitamins (like vitamin C) and fiber. Avoid frying to limit fat and calorie intake. Recipes like oven-roasted potatoes (Source 23) use olive oil and herbs for flavor without excessive additives, yielding 5g of protein and 53g of carbs per serving.  

3. **Variety-Specific Uses in Cooking**  
   - Different potato types suit specific dishes: Russets (baking/fries due to high starch), Reds (mashing/roasting for waxy texture), Yellows (balance for soups), and Purples (antioxidant-rich for roasting). Sweet potatoes are botanically distinct and richer in vitamin A. Selecting the right variety enhances texture and culinary outcomes (Sources 24, 29).  

4. **Potatoes as a Source of Antioxidants and Micronutrients**  
   - Purple and red potatoes are high in anthocyanins (antioxidants), while yellow varieties contain carotenoids. Russet potatoes rank fifth in antioxidant capacity among vegetables. They also provide 45% of daily vitamin C and 8% of fiber (per medium potato), supporting immune health and digestion (Sources 28, 30).  

5. **Sustainable and Disease-Resilient Growing Practices**  
   - Potatoes use less water and land per kilogram than many crops. Farmers in Washington use center-pivot irrigation and crop rotation (every 4 years) to manage diseases and soil fertility. New Zealandâ€™s growing method emphasizes certified seed potatoes, proper trench planting, and controlled fertilization for disease-free harvests (Sources 25, 27, 29).
