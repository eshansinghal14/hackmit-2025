**Agent 1 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. **Linear Equations and Vector Spaces**: Linear algebra deals with linear equations such as \(a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b\), linear maps, and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices.
2. **Applications in Mathematics and Science**: Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics, including geometry, functional analysis, and is used in most sciences and fields of engineering to model natural phenomena and compute efficiently with such models.
3. **Linear Maps and Matrices**: Linear algebra involves the study of linear maps such as \((x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mapsto a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_nx_n\), and their representations through matrices, which are fundamental in defining basic objects and transformations.
4. **First-Order Approximations for Nonlinear Systems**: Linear algebra is used for dealing with first-order approximations of nonlinear systems by utilizing the fact that the differential of a multivariate function at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.
5. **Foundational Role in Geometry and Analysis**: Linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry for defining basic objects such as lines, planes, and rotations, and in functional analysis, which may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to function spaces.
