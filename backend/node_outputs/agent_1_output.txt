**Agent 1 Knowledge Nodes for: Data Structures**

1. **Array Fundamentals and Dynamic Arrays**  
   Arrays are foundational, fixed-size data structures offering constant-time access by index. Dynamic arrays (e.g., Java’s `ArrayList`, Python’s `list`) automatically resize when elements exceed capacity, typically doubling in size. Understanding their time complexities (`O(1)` access, `O(n)` insertion/deletion) and use cases is essential for efficient data handling and implementing other data structures.

2. **Linked List Implementation and Operations**  
   Linked lists consist of nodes connected via pointers, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions but `O(n)` access time. Implementing singly and doubly linked lists, including operations like insert, delete, and reverse, is critical. They are often used in interview questions and systems where memory allocation is non-contiguous.

3. **Stack and Queue Principles and Use Cases**  
   Stacks follow LIFO (Last In, First Out) and are ideal for recursive algorithm management and undo mechanisms. Queues follow FIFO (First In, First Out) and are essential for breadth-first search and job scheduling. Both can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, depending on performance and memory considerations.

4. **Binary Search Trees (BST) Structure and Algorithms**  
   BSTs maintain sorted data with `O(log n)` average time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. Each node’s left subtree contains smaller keys and the right subtree larger keys. Handling insertion, deletion (including two-child removal via in-order successor), and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) is vital for applications requiring dynamic sorting and searching.

5. **Hash Tables and Hashing Techniques**  
   Hash tables store data in key-value pairs, offering average `O(1)` time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions. Concepts like hash functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing), and load factors are crucial. Hashing is widely used in dictionaries, caches, and indexing systems to enable fast data retrieval.
