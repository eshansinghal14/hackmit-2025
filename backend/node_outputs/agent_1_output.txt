**Agent 1 Knowledge Nodes for: Python Programming**

1. **Python Basics: Syntax, Variables, and Data Types**  
   Foundational understanding of Pythonâ€™s simple and readable syntax, variable declaration, and core data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans). Emphasis on writing and executing first programs, including basic operations and type conversions.

2. **Control Structures: Conditionals and Loops**  
   Practical use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making, along with `for` and `while` loops for iteration. Includes advanced patterns like nested loops, ternary operators, and loop-else constructs.

3. **Functions: Definition, Arguments, and Scope**  
   Creating reusable code through user-defined functions, using positional and keyword arguments, default parameters, and understanding local vs. global scope. Also includes lambda functions and multiple return values.

4. **Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**  
   Manipulating Python's built-in data structures, including list operations (e.g., sorting, slicing, joining), dictionary methods, and comprehension techniques for efficient data handling.

5. **Modules and Packages: Organization and Usage**  
   Structuring code with modules and packages, importing built-in and custom modules, and using standard library tools such as `os`, `sys`, `math`, and `random`. Introduction to `pip` for managing external libraries.
