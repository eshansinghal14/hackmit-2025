1. **Limits**: The concept of limits is fundamental in calculus, used to understand how functions behave as the input approaches a certain point, especially where the function itself may not be defined, such as division by zero.
2. **Derivatives and Differentiation Rules**: Derivatives measure the instantaneous rate of change of a function and can be found using various rules such as the power rule, product rule, and quotient rule, simplifying the process of differentiation for different types of functions.
3. **Implicit Derivatives**: This concept involves finding the derivative of a function that is not explicitly defined, such as in the case of a circle where the relationship between x and y is given implicitly, requiring a method to find the slope of the tangent line.
4. **Introduction to Calculus and Change**: Calculus is the study of change, focusing on functions and lines where the rate of change is not constant, such as a car's speed changing while driving, which can be analyzed through differentiation and integration.
5. **Continuity**: A function is considered continuous if it has no gaps or jumps, meaning that small changes in the input result in small changes in the output, which is a crucial property for many calculus applications, including the study of limits and derivatives.
