**Agent 1 Knowledge Nodes for: Python Programming**

1. **Python Fundamentals: Variables, Data Types, and Syntax**  
   - Understanding and declaring variables with proper naming conventions  
   - Working with core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
   - Writing clean, readable Python syntax and using the Python interpreter

2. **Control Flow and Looping Constructs**  
   - Implementing conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and comparison/logical operators  
   - Using `for` and `while` loops effectively, including nested loops and loop control techniques  
   - Applying ternary operators and short-circuit evaluations for concise logic

3. **Functions and Modular Code Development**  
   - Defining and calling user-defined functions with arguments and return values  
   - Using lambda functions for simple expressions  
   - Managing variable scope (global vs. local) and organizing code with modules and packages

4. **Python Environment Setup and Execution**  
   - Installing Python and setting up code editors/IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, IDLE)  
   - Running Python scripts via command line and understanding Python implementations (e.g., CPython, PyPy)  
   - Checking Python versions and utilizing Pythonâ€™s interactive shell (REPL)

5. **Core Programming Paradigms in Python**  
   - Applying object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming approaches  
   - Leveraging dynamic typing and optional type annotations  
   - Using built-in modules and libraries (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `math`, `random`) for common tasks
