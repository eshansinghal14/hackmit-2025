Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. This text is suitable for a sophomore level linear algebra course taught in about twenty-five lectures. It is designed both for engineering and science majors, but has enough abstraction to be useful for potential math majors. Our goal in writing it was to produce students who can perform computations with linear systems and also understand the concepts behind these computations.

 I dont think linear algebra started out as pure mathematics then found use cases. Imagine you are an early mathematician, what problems were you trying to solve? How did linear algebra help? How does it help in todays world? (If you can, please use engineering examples). Im trying to write down reasons for students to even want to learn linear algebra. But not knowing enough about it I am struggling compiling information on it.

 A much harder question is "what is linear algebra NOT used for?" It comes up in pretty much every branch of modern mathematics and extends to applications in pretty much every STEM field.

 I’ve heard that every mathematical operation can be reduced to addition. That’s certainly true for multiplying and exponents, but perhaps it can also work with more complicated concepts too. If that’s the case, we could also say that everything is just few steps away from addition.

 Yeah. Like ... How about function composition? That doesn't resemble "addition" in any reasonable way, as far as I can tell. Or commutator \[a,b\] = ab - ba? That's not even associative. Edit: ooh. They probably meant that subtraction is adding negatives, multiplication is repeated addition, division is inverse multiplication, exponents are repeated multiplication... All basic arithmetic is connected to addition in some way. That makes sense.

 Yeah, the simplest evidence being that the additive identity and multiplicative identity are in general not the same. Addition and multiplication don't seem to interact much in rings.

### Source 36: An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra – BetterExplained

**Content:**
Despite two linear algebra classes, my knowledge consisted of “Matrices, determinants, eigen something something”.

Why? Well, let’s try this course format:

- Name the course _Linear Algebra_ but focus on things called matrices and vectors
- Teach concepts like Row/Column order with mnemonics instead of explaining the reasoning
- Favor abstract examples (2d vectors! 3d vectors!) and avoid real-world topics until the final week

The survivors are physicists, graphics programmers and other masochists. We missed the key insight:

**Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.**

We can take a table of data (a matrix) and create updated tables from the original. It’s the power of a spreadsheet written as an equation.

Here’s the linear algebra introduction I wish I had, with a real-world stock market example.

## What’s in a name?

“Algebra” means, roughly, “relationships”. Grade-school algebra explores the relationship between unknown numbers. Without knowing x and y, we can still work out that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.

“Linear Algebra” means, roughly, “line-like relationships”. Let’s clarify a bit.

Straight lines are predictable. Imagine a rooftop: move forward 3 horizontal feet (relative to the ground) and you might rise 1 foot in elevation (The slope! Rise/run = 1/3). Move forward 6 feet, and you’d expect a rise of 2 feet. Contrast this with climbing a dome: each horizontal foot forward raises you a different amount.

Lines are nice and predictable:

- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, then going 10x as far should give a 10x rise (30 feet forward is a 10-foot rise)
- If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, and 6 feet has a 2-foot rise, then (3 + 6) feet should have a (1 + 2) foot rise

In math terms, an operation F is linear if scaling inputs scales the output, and adding inputs adds the outputs:

In our example, $F(x)$ calculates the rise when moving forward x feet, and the properties hold:

## Linear Operations

An operation is a calculation based on some inputs. Which operations are linear and predictable? Multiplication, it seems.

Exponents ($F(x) = x^2$) aren’t predictable: $10^2$ is 100, but $20^2$ is 400. We doubled the input but quadrupled the output.

Surprisingly, regular addition isn’t linear either. Consider the “add three” function $F(x) = x + 3$:

We doubled the input and did not double the output. (Yes, $F(x) = x + 3$ happens to be the equation for an _offset_ line, but it’s still not “linear” because $F(10) \\neq 10 \\cdot F(1)$. Fun.)

So, what types of functions are _actually_ linear? Plain-old scaling by a constant, or functions that look like: $F(x) = ax$. In our roof example, $a = 1/3$.

But life isn’t _too_ boring. We can still combine multiple linear functions ($A(x) = ax, B(x) = bx, C(x)=cx$) into a larger one, $G$:

$G$ is still linear, since doubling the input continues to double the output:

We have “mini arithmetic”: multiply inputs by a constant, and add the results. It’s actually usefu... [Content truncated for context window]

# **Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics**

## **Free online text by Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling**

**Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics**
is an introductory textbook designed for undergraduate mathematics majors
with an emphasis on abstraction and in particular the concept of
proofs in the setting of linear algebra. Typically such a student
will have taken calculus, though the only prerequisite is suitable
mathematical maturity. The purpose of this book is to bridge the gap
between the more conceptual and computational oriented lower division
undergraduate classes to the more abstract oriented upper division
classes. The book begins with systems of linear equations and complex
numbers, then relates these to the abstract notion of linear maps on
finite-dimensional vector spaces, and covers diagonalization,
eigenspaces, determinants, and the Spectral Theorem. Each chapter
concludes with both proof-writing and computational exercises.

**Content:**
1\. What is linear algebra
2\. Introduction to complex numbers
3\. The fundamental theorem of algebra and factoring polynomials
4\. Vector spaces
5\. Span and bases
6\. Linear maps
7\. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
8\. Permutations and the determinant
9\. Inner product spaces
10\. Change of bases
11\. The spectral theorem for normal linear maps
12\. Supplementary notes on matrices and linear systems
Appendix: The language of sets and functions; algebraic structures encountered; common math symbols; notation used

## Story Time

Linear algebra was founded around the same time as Calculus (think Leibniz, circa 1700) solely for the purpose of solving general systems of linear equations. The coefficients of a system were written in a grid form, with rows corresponding to equations and columns to the unknown variables. Using a computational tool called the _determinant_ (an awkward, but computable formula involving only the coefficients of the equations in a system), researchers were able to solve these systems, opening a world of information about the positions of celestial bodies and large-scale measurements (of geodesic arcs) on the surface of the earth.

By the 1850’s, Arthur Cayley was representing matrices as abstract objects. He defined matrix multiplication and nurtured matrix theory as its own field, recognizing a vast wealth of theoretical knowledge underlying the theory of determinants. Around turn of the century, a formal system of vector algebra was invented which relied heavily on interpreting matrices as so-called _linear transformations._ Linear transformations are intuitively those maps of everyday space ($ \\mathbb{R}^n$) which preserve “linear” things. Specifically, they send lines to lines, planes to planes, etc., and they preserve the origin (one which does not preserve the origin is very similar but has a different name; see [Affine Transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation)). Soon enough the mathematical focus shifted to the foundations of such an algebra, and later with the advent of computers to rapid calculations in one.

## Motivations

Linear algebra sits at the crossroads of many areas of mathematics. Keeping close to its roots, linear algebra is primarily a tool for computation. Unsurprisingly, a huge chunk of mathematical research has been solely to phrase things in terms of matrices and their associated linear transformations. For instance, an undirected graph on $ n$ vertices can be modeled as a matrix of integer entries, with the $ i,j$ entry containing the number of edges from vertex $ i$ to vertex $ j$. This is called the _adjacency matrix_ of a graph. Suddenly, a wealth of information a... [Content truncated for context window]
