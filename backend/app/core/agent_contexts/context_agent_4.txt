### Source 31: A BetterExplained Guide To Calculus – BetterExplained

**Content:**
**Update:** there is now a [Calculus Course](https://betterexplained.com/calculus/lesson-1) available

I’ve struggled with how to write about calculus. The standard techniques seem to be:

- The “bag of formulas”: memorize ‘em and move on
- The anal-retentive, rigorous treatment: written by math robots, for math robots!
- The happy smiles tour: oversimplifications without examples (Calculus helps scientists solve problems!)

No, nyet, nein! I know what I need: intuition ( _What does it really mean?_) followed by examples to back it up. I want a calculus series that lets calculus be calculus — wild, interesting, and fun.

## The Explanatory Approach

I started writing in a vacuum, but realized I don’t remember calculus. I need a refresher — in fact, I need the insights I want to share! These articles are for us both (it’s what I’d want to relearn the subject), and here’s my approach:

- I’m reading [Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach \[free pdf\]](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html). It teaches calculus using its original approach (infinitesimals), not the modern limit-based curriculum. My goal is intuition, so this works well.

- As I study the chapters, I’ll share the insights I find and the concepts I struggled with.

- I’ll sprinkle examples along the way. They’re a gut check, not the focus (if you want practice problems, the book has plenty).


It’s a lack of insights, not information, that makes calculus hard. We don’t need another course repeating the definitions that confused us the first time ( _Here’s the definition of a limit, again!_).

We shouldn’t be struggling with the true meaning of a subject centuries after its invention. This is my intuition-laced hat in the ring.

## The Calculus Articles

The goal is to be concise, informal, and fun. Dabble, skim and ignore the examples if needed — focus on the insights. The elegance of calculus can be appreciated progressively: we don’t need astrophysics to enjoy a starry night.

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to Know for Calculus I
#### Related Subjects
[∫ Calculus I](https://library.fiveable.me/calc-i)
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration, two key ideas in calculus. It has two parts that help evaluate definite integrals and understand how functions behave, showing that integrals can be calculated using antiderivatives.
01. **Definition of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
- Connects differentiation and integration, two core concepts in calculus.
- Comprises two main parts that provide a framework for evaluating definite integrals and understanding the behavior of functions.
- Establishes that the integral of a function can be computed using its antiderivative.
02. **Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem (Evaluation of definite integrals)**
- States that if ( f ) is continuous on (\[a, b\]) and ( F ) is an antiderivative of ( f ), then:
\[
\\int\_a^b f(x) , dx = F(b) - F(a)
\]
- Provides a method to calculate the area under the curve of ( f ) from ( a ) to ( b ).
- Emphasizes the importance of continuity for the theorem to hold true.
03. **Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem (Derivative of an integral function)**
- States that if ( f ) is continuous on an interval, then the function defined by:
\[
F(x) = \\int\_a^x f(t) , dt
\]
is differentiable, and ( F'(x) = f(x) ).
- Shows that differentiation and integration are inverse processes.
- Highlights how the rate of change of the area function ( F(x) ) corresponds to the value of the function ( f(x) ).
04. **Relationship between differentiation and integration**
- Differentiation measures the rate of change, while integration accumulates quantities.
- The Fundamental Theorem illustrates that these two operations are interconnected.
- Understanding this relationship is crucial for solving complex calculus problems.
05. **Applications in finding areas under curves**
- Allows for the calculation of the area between the curve of a function and the x-axis over a specified interval.
- Useful in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics for modeling real-world scenarios.
- Provides a systematic approach to solving problems involving area calculations.
06. **Antiderivatives and indefinite integrals**
- An antiderivative of a function ( f ) is a function ( F ) such that ( F' = f ).
- Indefinite integrals represent a family of functions that differ by a constant, denoted as:
\[
\\int f(x) , dx = F(x) + C
\]
- Understanding antiderivatives is essential for applying the Fundamental Theorem effectively.
07. **Evaluating definite integrals using antiderivatives**
- Involves finding an antiderivative ( F ) of ( f ) and applying the evaluation formula:
\[
\\int\_a^b f(x) , dx = F(b) - F(a)
\]
- Simplifies the process of calculating areas and other quantities represented by definite integrals.

### Source 38: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

**Content:**
[Home](https://calcworkshop.com/) » [Integrals](https://calcworkshop.com/integrals/) » **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
In the process of studying calculus, you quickly realize that there are two major themes: differentiation and integration. Differential calculus helps us explain slope and tangents whereas integral calculus helps us solve problems involving area.
![Evaluating an integral of a rate of change](https://calcworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/fundamental-theorem-calculus.png)
Total Change Theorem
And at first glance it may seem that these two ideas are disjointed, they are in fact intrinsically connected as inverse processes. As it happens, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or FTC, displays this inverse relationship beautifully.
The fundamental theorem of calculus is actually divided into two parts: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the **Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1 (FTC 1), pertains to definite integrals and enables us to easily find numerical values for the area under a curve.
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2 (FTC 2), enables us to take the derivative of an integral and nicely demonstrates how the function and its derivative are forever linked, as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus) asserts.
![Using integration properties to find area and distance](https://calcworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/evaluating-integrals-properties.png)
Properties of the Definite Integral
These two critical forms of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, allows us to make some remarkable connections between the geometric and analytical components of indefinite and definite integrals.
We will also see how our Integration Rules and Properties.
The properties of the definite integral, along with the Fundamental Theorem, help us when we are not explicitly given a function, or when we are only given a velocity graph.
The fundamental theorem of calculus is not only easy to understand and implement but is considered by many to be one of the greatest achievements in all of mathematics.

### Source 39: Calculus: Understanding the Foundation of Modern Mathematics

**Content:**
## **What is Calculus?**

Calculus is one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics, primarily concerned with understanding and analyzing change. It is a powerful tool used in a variety of fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and even medicine. Calculus consists of two main branches: **differential calculus** and **integral calculus**.

- **Differential Calculus** focuses on the concept of the derivative, which measures the rate at which quantities change.
- **Integral Calculus** deals with accumulation, such as calculating areas under curves or determining the total quantity when the rate of change is known.

Together, these two branches help in solving complex real-world problems, from predicting the speed of moving objects to modelling economic trends.

## **When is Calculus Introduced in Schools?**

Calculus is generally introduced in the later years of high school, around **11th or 12th grade**, depending on the educational curriculum. For some advanced programs, such as the **International Baccalaureate (IB)** or **Advanced Placement (AP)** courses in the United States, students may begin to study it as early as **Grade 11**. In other curriculums, such as the **CBSE or IGCSE** in India, calculus is part of the senior secondary education syllabus.

## **Different Levels of Calculus in School Curriculums**

Calculus is taught in a structured progression:

We have [previously](https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculus-in-machine-learning-why-it-works/) seen that calculus is one of the core mathematical concepts in machine learning that permits us to understand the internal workings of different machine learning algorithms.

Calculus, in turn, builds on several fundamental concepts that derive from algebra and geometry. The importance of having these fundamentals at hand will become even more important as we work our way through more advanced topics of calculus, such as the evaluation of limits and the computation of derivatives, to name a few.

In this tutorial, you will discover several pre-requisites that will help you work with calculus.

After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- Linear and non-linear functions are central to calculus and machine learning, and many calculus problems involve their use.
- Fundamental concepts from algebra and trigonometry provide the foundations for calculus, and will become especially important as we tackle more advanced calculus topics.

## **Tutorial Overview**

This tutorial is divided into three parts; they are:

- The Concept of a Function
- Fundamentals of Pre-Algebra and Algebra
- Fundamentals of Trigonometry

## **The Concept of a Function**

A function is a rule that defines the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.

> _Examples are all around us: The average daily temperature for your city depends on, and is a function of, the time of year; the distance an object has fallen is a function of how much time has elapsed since you dropped it; the area of a circle is a function of its radius; and the pressure of an enclosed gas is a function of its temperature._

In machine learning, a neural network learns a function by which it can represent the relationship between features in the input, the independent variable, and the expected output, the dependent variable. In such a scenario, therefore, the learned function defines a deterministic mapping between the input values and one or more output values. We can repres... [Content truncated for context window]
