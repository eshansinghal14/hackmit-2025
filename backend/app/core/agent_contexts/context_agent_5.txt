 I am studying Chemistry, and in the first semester I noticed that my math skills are somewhat terrible and that I have a clear lack of basics But I'm unsure what lacks - although you can't look into my mind, you could say what you would consider as basics needed for a deep understanding of calculus / linear algebra / analysis

 I've got some experience teaching calc I and II so I can offer some advice. Be very good at your algebra. In my opinion, that hardest part of calculus, is the algebra! Its all the stuff you learned before calculus that you probably forgot. Things like adding/subtracting rational expressions, simplifying exponents, factoring, and so on. From your post, I'd recommend going through Alg II again. I'd get out my notebook and hit up Khan Academy! Or get a textbook! Being very good at algebra got me through my undergrad. When you start having to prove things, it becomes a different story.

 So much this. My algebra killed my first two calculus exams. I knew the calculus side of the math to the point that I just wrote out what was supposed to be done and admitted I knew I was going to lose significant points for the algebra.

 All of this. My tutor way back when said there was a quote that went "you don't really learn algebra until you do calculus". Man she wasn't kidding. If your algebra is dialed in you're well on your way.

 Not exhaustive, but these are where I see a lot of mistakes and gaps in knowledge: * Factoring and expanding polynomials * Distributive properties * Properties of exponents and logarithms (x^α * x^β = x^α+β , μlog(x) = log(x^μ )) * Good intuition regarding functions (things like domain/range, knowing what quadratic/cubic functions look like, being able to spot horizontal/vertical shifts, etc.) * Calculating roots (quadratic formula, completion of the square, synthetic division) * Having a good conceptual understanding of basic trigonometry as well being able to carry out calculations relating to trigonometry

## Description

Based on more than a decade of classroom experience, this book provides mastery of calculus’s core by focusing on the foundational concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals, explaining how all three are united in the fundamental theorem of calculus. Moreover, Calculus for Everyone explains how the story of calculus is central to Western culture, from Plato in ancient Greece, to today’s modern physics. Indeed, this book explains why calculus is needed at all—and why it is needed so badly. By mastering the core of calculus—as well as seeing its meaning and significance—students will not only better understand math and science in general, but contemporary culture and their place in it.

Calculus for Everyone includes:

- Main student textbook (hardback, 490 pages)
- Exercise Solutions (paperback, 149 pages)
- Complete video course, taught by Dr. Mitch Stokes (streaming)

**[Try sample lessons](https://mycompassclassroom.com/courses/calculus-for-everyone/) in our online learning platform.**

Dr. Mitch Stokes presents the mathematics of change in an extremely effective way for anyone with a first-year course in algebra. Yet it does so without dumbing calculus down. It represents one of the first tangible steps in recent years at reunifying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) with the liberal arts. The goal is to produce a generation of classically educated students who understand the history of math, and will be better equipped to solve problems like our current crisis in Physics.

Beautifully designed with over 600 hand-drawn illustrations in the textbook and a video curriculum with hand-drawn exercises walking students methodically through the course, this curriculum seeks to mend the broken relationship between the liberal arts and STEM, between science and the humanities.

**Prerequisite:**

The only prerequisite for this course is a very basic understanding of Algebra 1. The student should, for example, be familiar with polynomials and be able to manipulate such polynomials (e.g., by combining like terms and manipulating exponents). The focus of the textbook is on the concepts of calculus proper and not on calculus’s further application to increasingly complicated functions, such as rational, trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions. By keeping to polynomials throughout the course (or, more accurately, to power functions)... [Content truncated for context window]

## 0.1 Things to Know for Calculus

**Congrats on making it to Calculus!!!  Below is a reference packet covering all of the material that you are expected to know (without a calculator).  If you had Mr. Brust for the Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calc then you should be golden, if you had Mr. Bean then I am sorry.  Browse through the packet, hopefully everything comes back to you.  If not, you can reference videos from this site to review the topics that you need a refresher on.**

* * *

**Here is a short video showing trig functions using special right triangles.  We only did the Unit Circle method in Pre-Calc, but many students prefer this method for Calculus.  You can use whatever method works for you.**

**Here is a breakdown on the AP Calc Exam.  We will practice Multiple Choice and Free Response throughout the entire year.  All packets assume that you will NOT use the calculator unless the questions are specifically marked.  Don't freak out and don't try to sneak that calculator on non calculator portions!!!  We only show step by step solutions to the odd problems for Calculus and just give the answer for even problems.  Keep working even problems until you can get it to match the correct answer.  This is a great way to learn the material.  The more time you put into the packets, the better prepared you will be for the exam!  Stay on pace, ask questions, and earn some college credit!!!**

## About the course

_Calculus for Everyone_ is a classical approach to mathematics that allows any high school student who has completed a first-year algebra course to learn the fundamentals of calculus. This integrated course examines the history of its development, beginning with the problem of change, and focuses on “the concepts of calculus proper” (Stokes, 2020, p. xvii), encompassing physics and philosophy of motion as well as “real calculus: derivatives, integrals, limits, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus” (p. xxvi).

This class is divided into four eight-week quarters. Students will be assigned readings, lectures, exercises, and quizzes, emphasizing both the history of the development of calculus and the mathematical knowledge of limits, derivatives, and integrals. In the convention of the flipped-classroom model, students will complete assignments before attending the weekly 1.5-hour live recitation (note: two weeks will be asynchronous discussions.) Each quarter will end with an exam testing the material covered in that quarter, with the exception of the final quarter which will end with a comprehensive final exam.

Course Prerequisite and Sequencing:

**Prerequisite:** The successful completion of Algebra I

This course is ideal for students who:

- Are seeking a classical approach to Calculus.
- Value an historical approach that integrates mathematics with natural philosophy.
- Want to understand real-life applications for Calculus.
- Are STEM minded, Liberal Arts minded, or both.
- Are unsure if they would like to take a Calculus course.
- Have decided to take Calculus at some point.

_Calculus for Everyone_ may be taken before, after, or alongside Geometry but should not be taken at its expense. It is not a substitute for Pre-Calculus (Trigonometry) nor is it equivalent to AP/collegiate Calculus I. Rather, by avoiding the mire of transcendental functions, it provides foundational skills and understanding, giving crucial perspective to philosophy, science, and mathematics. Dr. Stokes asserts, “CALCULUS ISN'T A LUXURY ... Until our students learn the fundament... [Content truncated for context window]

Calculus is the broad area of mathematics dealing with such topics as instantaneous rates of change, areas under curves, and sequences and series. Underlying all of these topics is the concept of a limit, which consists of analyzing the behavior of a function at points ever closer to a particular point, but without ever actually reaching that point. Calculus has two basic applications: differential calculus and integral calculus.

- [12.0: Prelude to Calculus](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Precalculus_1e_(OpenStax)/12%3A_Introduction_to_Calculus/12.00%3A_Prelude_to_Calculus)Like the fastest land animal, a cheetah, a person does not run at his top speed at every instant. How then, do we approximate his speed at any given instant? We will find the answer to this and many related questions in this chapter.
- [12.1: Finding Limits - Numerical and Graphical Approaches](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Precalculus_1e_(OpenStax)/12%3A_Introduction_to_Calculus/12.01%3A_Finding_Limits_-_Numerical_and_Graphical_Approaches)In this section, we will examine numerical and graphical approaches to identifying limits.
- [12.2: Finding Limits - Properties of Limits](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Precalculus_1e_(OpenStax)/12%3A_Introduction_to_Calculus/12.02%3A_Finding_Limits_-_Properties_of_Limits)Graphing a function or exploring a table of values to determine a limit can be cumbersome and time-consuming. When possible, it is more efficient to use the properties of limits, which is a collection of theorems for finding limits. Knowing the properties of limits allows us to compute limits directly.
- [12.3: Continuity](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Precalculus_1e_(OpenStax)/12%3A_Introduction_to_Calculus/12.03%3A_Continuity)A function that remains level for an interval and then jumps instantaneously to a higher value is called a stepwise function. This function is an example. A function that has any hole or break in its graph is known as a discontinuous function. A stepwise function, such as parking-garage charges as a function of hours parked, is an example of a discontinuous function. We can check three different conditions to decide if a function is continuous at a particular number.
- [12.4: Derivatives](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Precalculus_1e_(OpenStax)/12%3A_Introduction_to_Calculus/12.04%3A_Derivatives)Change divided by time is one example of a rate. The rates of change in the previous examples are each different. In other words, some changed faster than others. If we were to graph the functions, we could compare the rates by determining the slopes of the graphs.
