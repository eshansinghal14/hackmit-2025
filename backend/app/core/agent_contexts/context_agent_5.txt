# Mastering Linear Algebra - Key concepts like matrices, determinants and linear transformations

In this course, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of linear algebra, including key concepts like vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix operations.

Table of contents

## What is included in a linear algebra course?

The following 28 topics are typically included in a linear algebra course

1\. Vectors

A vector in physics represents a force with a given direction, magnitude and origin. But in linear algebra, a vector has the first two properties but lacks an origin. Therefore, it can be moved if you want.

2\. Lines and planes in space

The equation for a straight line is only defined for two dimensions. It does not however stop them from existing in higher dimensions, where we define them in parametric or vector form.

* * *

3\. Linear systems of equations

Bunching together several equations creates a system of equations, and a solution for the system must solve each of the system's equations. The system is said to be linear if each equation is of the form:
$$
a\_1x\_1 + a\_2x\_2 + \\ldots + a\_nx\_n
$$

4\. Gauss-Jordan

Gauss-Jordan is a method for solving a linear system of equations. Each system falls into one of three cases; unique solution, no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

5\. Matrix arithmetics

Matrix arithmetics are defined for addition, subtraction and multiplication. For the two former the matrices must have equal dimensions and the operations are commutative. Multiplication is however not commutative, and is only defined for when the number of rows of the left matrix is equal to the number of columns of the right matrix.

6\. Inverse matrices

The inverse to a matrix is another matrix, and the product of the matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix.

7\. Linear dependence

If a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors, the bunch is then considered as linearly dependent. If not, the vectors are considered to be linearly independent.

8\. Solution space

A solution space is the vector space containing all solutions to a given system. It does follow the properties of vector spaces, so if $\\vec{x}\_1$ and $\\vec{x}\_1$ are solutions to
$$A\\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$$
then we have that
$$k\_1\\vec{x}\_1 + k\_2\\vec{x}\_2$$
is a solution for any values o... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 43: How to Self Study Linear Algebra for Students

**Content:**
**Estimated Read Time:** 5 minute(s)

**Common Topics:** algebra, linear, amazon, book, books

In this insight, I will give a roadmap to learn the basics of linear algebra for students. Aside from calculus, linear algebra is one of the most applicable subjects of all of mathematics. It is used a lot in engineering, sciences, computer sciences, etc. The right way to see linear algebra is with a focus on vector spaces and linear transformations. So I will suggest books with this perspective in mind.

Table of Contents

Toggle

## **Prerequisites**

There are essentially two prerequisites for studying linear algebra, besides the usual high school courses which include algebra, geometry and trigonometry (no, calculus is not a formal prerequisite). Those are that you must be used to proofs, and that you must have seen the basics of matrices and determinants.

For proofs, I recommend the following books in no particular order:
Velleman “How to prove it: a structured approach” [http://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995?tag=pfamazon01-20)
Bloch’s “Proofs and fundamentals: a first course in abstract mathematics” http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Fundamentals-Abstract-Mathematics-Undergraduate/dp/1441971262
Hammack’s “Book of proof” [http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)

These books will teach you the fundamentals of [proof based mathematics](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/proofs-in-mathematics/), and they will teach you the basic notations and assumptions of set theory. Both will be very necessary for algebra.

As for matrices and determinants, these should be covered in basic high school books. For example
Lang’s “Basic Mathematics” [http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877?tag=pfamazon01-20)
Openstaxcollege’s Algebra [https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-algebra](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-algebra)
Khan Academy’s Linear algebra [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix\_transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix_transformations)

Don’t worry, you don’t need to know matrices and determinants in full detail. Just knowing them for the 2×2 and 3×3 cases is already enough. In the linear algebra books which I’m going to mention, matrices and determinants will be treated in their full gory details. Also, don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of intuition for matrices and determinants, this intuition will come with studying vector spaces. Right now you are merely expected to being able to compute stuff like inverses of matrices and solving systems of equations.

## **Linear algebra: Introduction**

Proper linear algebra deals with vector spaces and linear transformations between them. It will rigorously develop the theory of nxn matrices and... [Content truncated for context window]

as well as by thousands of people
for independent study.
- Applications
Each chapter finishes with four or five short
supplemental topics
for reading or projects, or for
small group work.

# Preface

This linear algebra textbook was originally designed to be presented as twenty five, fifty minute lectures
suitable for sophomores likely to use the material for applications but still requiring
a solid foundation in this fundamental branch of mathematics. The main idea of the course is
to emphasize the concepts of vector spaces and linear transformations as mathematical
structures that can be used to model the world around us. Once \`\`persuaded'' of this truth, students
learn explicit skills such as Gaussian elimination and diagonalization in order that vectors and linear transformations
become calculational tools, rather than abstract mathematics.

In practical terms, the course aims to produce students who can perform computations with large linear systems
while at the same time understand the concepts behind these techniques. Often-times when a problem can be
reduced to one of linear algebra it is \`\`solved''. These notes
do not devote much space to applications (there are already a plethora of textbooks with titles involving some
permutation of the words \`\`linear'', \`\`algebra'' and \`\`applications''). Instead, they attempt to explain the fundamental
concepts carefully enough that students will realize for their own selves when the particular application they encounter
in future studies is ripe for a solution via linear algebra.

The notes are designed to be used in conjunction with a set of online homework exercises which help the students read the
lecture notes and learn
basic linear algebra skills. Interspersed among the lecture notes are links to simple online problems that
test whether students are actively reading the notes. In addition there are two sets of sample midterm problems with solutions as well
as a sample final exam.
There are also a set of ten online assignments which are collected weekly.
The first assignment is designed to ensure familiarity with some basic mathematic notions (sets, functions, logical quantifiers and basic methods of proof). The remaining nine assignments are devoted to the usual matrix and vector gymnastics expected from
any sophomore linear algebra class. These exercises are all available [here.](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/homework.html)
Webwork is an open source, online homework system which originated at the University of Rochester. It can efficiently check whether a student
has answered an explicit, typically computation-based, problem correctly. The problem sets chosen to accompany these
notes could contribute roughly 20% of a student's grade, and ensure that basic computational skills are mastered.
Most students rapidly realize that it is best to print out the Webwork assignments and solve them on paper before
entering the answers online. Those who do not tend to fare poorly on midterm examinations. We have found that there
tend to be relatively few questions from students in office hours about the Webwork assignments. Instead, by assigning 20%
of the grade to written assignments... [Content truncated for context window]
