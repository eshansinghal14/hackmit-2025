New course

Learn the basics of calculus with Infinity Learn’s free online course. Covering fundamental topics like limits, differentiation, and integration in an easy-to-understand format.

## Course Description

Calculus Basics is an exhaustive course designed for individuals embarking on their journey into the world of calculus. Spanning a comprehensive duration of 2 hours and 42 minutes, this course dives deep into the foundational concepts essential for mastering calculus.

The course begins with an introductory section, setting the stage for what’s to come and ensuring that students understand the importance and relevance of calculus in various fields. Following this, Lesson 1 elaborates on the question "Why Calculus?" providing a contextual framework for learners to appreciate the subject's significance and applications.

As students progress, Lesson 2 tackles one of the central concepts in calculus: limits. This lesson is crucial as it lays the groundwork for understanding continuous functions and the behavior of functions as they approach specific points. Next, the course delves into differentiation in Lesson 3, expounding on how to calculate the derivative of a function and elucidating its myriad applications.

Integration, another cornerstone of calculus, is thoroughly explored in Lesson 4. Here, students learn about integrating functions and the fundamental techniques to compute these integrals. Lessons 5 and 6 focus on functions themselves, providing a robust understanding of what functions are, how they are expressed, and their importance in calculus.

Building on this foundational knowledge, the course moves to advanced differentiation topics in Lesson 7 and Lesson 8, detailing how to find the derivatives of more complex functions. The nuances of derivatives, including situations where derivatives do not exist, are explored comprehensively in Lessons 9 and 10.

Moving forward, Lesson 11 discusses the derivative as a function in itself, reinforcing ... [Content truncated for context window]

# Introduction to Calculus

Calculus is all about _**changes**_.

| |
| --- |
| Sam and Alex are traveling in the car ... but the speedometer is broken. |

Alex:

"Hey Sam! How fast are we going now?"

Sam:

"Wait a minute ...

Well in the last minute we went 1.2 km, so we are going:

1.2 km per minute x 60 minutes in an hour _=_ **72 km/h**"

Alex:

"No, Sam! Not our **average** for the last minute, or even the last second, I want to know our speed RIGHT NOW."

Sam:

"OK, let us measure it up here ... at this road sign... NOW!"

"OK, we were **at** the sign for **zero seconds**, and the distance was ... **zero meters**!"

The speed is 0m / 0s _=_ 0/0 _=_ **I Don't Know**!

"I can't calculate it, Alex! I need to know **some** distance over **some** time, and you are saying the time should be zero? Can't be done."

That is pretty amazing ... you'd think it is easy to work out the speed of a car at any point in time, but it isn't.

Even the speedometer of a car just shows an **average** of how fast we were going for the last (very short) amount of time.

## How About Getting Real Close

But our story is not finished yet!

Sam and Alex get out of the car, because they have arrived on location. Sam is about to do a stunt:

| |
| --- |
| ### Sam will do a jump off a 20 m building. ### Alex, as photographer, asks: ### "How fast will you be falling after 1 second?" |

Sam uses this simplified formula to find **the distance fallen**:

d _=_ 5t2

- d _=_ distance fallen, in meters
- t _=_ time from jump, in seconds

_(Note: the formula is a simpler version of falling due to [gravity](https://www.mathsisfun.com/physics/gravity.html): d = ½gt2)_

Example: at 1 second Sam has fallen

**d _=_ 5t2 _=_ 5 × 12 _=_ 5 m**

But how **fast** is that? Speed is distance over time:

Speed _=_ _distance_ **time**

So at 1 second:

Speed _=_ _5 m_ **1 second** _=_ 5 m/s

"BUT", says Alex, "again that is an **average speed**, since you started the jump, ... I want to know the speed at **exactly** 1 second, so I can set up the camera properly."

Well ... at **exactly 1 second** the speed is:

Speed _=_ _5 − 5 m_ **1 − 1 s** _=_ _0 m_ **0 s** _=_ ???

So again Sam has a problem.

Think about it ... how do we figure out a speed at an exact instant in time?

What is the distance? What is the time difference?

They are both **zero**, giving us nothing to calculate with!

But Sam has an idea ... invent a time **so short it won't matter**.

Sam won't even give it a value, and will just call it "Δt" (called "delta t").

So Sam works out the difference in distance between **t** and **t+Δt**

At **1 second** Sam has fallen

5t2 _=_ 5 × (1)2 _=_ 5 m

At **(1+Δt) seconds** Sam has fallen

5t2 _=_ 5 × (1+Δt)2 m

We can [expand](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/expanding.html) **(1+Δt)2**:

(1+Δt)2= (1+Δt)(1+Δt)= 1 + 2Δt + (Δt)2

So at **(1+Δt) seconds** Sam has so far fallen:

d= 5 × (1+2Δt+(Δt)2) m= **5 + 10Δt + 5(Δt)2 m**

In Summary:

At 1 second:d _=_ 5 mAt (1+Δt) seconds:d _=_ ... [Content truncated for context window]

Preface
This book is a revised and expanded version of the lecture notes for Basic Calculus and other similar courses
offered by the Department of Mathematics, University of Hong Kong, from the first semester of the academic
year 1998-1999 through the second semester of 2006-2007. It can be used as a textbook or a reference book
for an introductory course on one variable calculus.
In this book, much emphasis is put on explanations of concepts and solutions to examples. By reading
the book carefully, students should be able to understand the concepts introduced and know how to answer
questions with justification. At the end of each section (except the last few), there is an exercise. Students
are advised to do as many questions as possible. Most of the exercises are simple drills. Such exercises may
not help students understand the concepts; however, without practices, students may find it difficult to continue
reading the subsequent sections.
Chapter 0 is written for students who have forgotten the materials that they have learnt for HKCEE Mathematics. Students who are familiar with the materials may skip this chapter.
Chapter 1 is on sets, real numbers and inequalities. Since the concept of sets is new to most students, detail
explanations and elaborations are given. For the real number system, notations and terminologies that will
be used in the rest of the book are introduced. For solving polynomial inequalities, the method will be used
later when we consider where a function is increasing or decreasing as well as where a function is convex or
concave. Students should note that there is a shortcut for solving inequalities, using the Intermediate Value
Theorem discussed in Chapter 3.
Chapter 2 is on functions and graphs. Some materials are covered by HKCEE Mathematics. New concepts
introduced include domain and range (which are fundamental concepts related to functions); composition of
functions (which will be needed when we consider the Chain Rule for differentiation) and inverse functions
(which will be needed when we consider exponential functions and logarithmic functions).
In Chapter 3, intuitive idea of limit is introduced. Limit is a fundamental concept in calculus. It is used
when we consider differentiation (to define derivatives) and integration (to define definite integrals). There are
many types of limits. Students should notice that their definitions are similar. To help students understand
such similarities, a summary is given at the end of the section on two-sided limits. The section of continuous
functions is rather conceptual. Students should understand the statements of the Intermediate Value Theorem
(several versions) and the Extreme Value Theorem.
In Chapters 4 and 5, basic concepts and applications of differentiation are discussed. Students who know
how to work on limits of functions at a point should be able to apply ... [Content truncated for context window]

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: A Complete Guide for Beginners

Table of Contents

How can a single theorem connect two of the most fundamental concepts in calculus—differentiation and integration? The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** does exactly that, serving as the bridge between these two pillars of mathematics. Without it, solving real-world problems involving motion, area, or rates of change would be far more complex.

Whether you’re a student struggling to grasp the basics or someone curious about how calculus shapes the world around us, this guide will break down the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** in a way that’s easy to understand. For example, imagine trying to calculate the displacement of a car over time using its velocity function. Once you [learn calculus](https://fastlearner.ai/student/course-details/mastering-calculus-a-comprehensive-guide-to-mathematical-analysis) and understand this theorem, solving such real-world problems becomes not only possible but intuitive. By the end of this guide, you’ll know what the theorem is and how it applies to everything from physics to economics.

Let’s dive in!

## What Is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?

The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, two core concepts in calculus. It consists of two parts:

### The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The **first fundamental theorem of calculus** states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \[a,b\]\[a, b\]\[a,b\], and F(x)F(x)F(x) is its antiderivative, then the definite integral of the function can be calculated as:

∫abf(x) dx=F(b)−F(a)\\int\_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) – F(a) ∫ab​f(x)dx=F(b)−F(a)

This means that instead of calculating the area under a curve manually, you can use the antiderivative to find the result quickly.

### The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The **second fundamental theorem of calculus** states that if f(x)f(x)f(x) is a continuous function on an interval, then the derivative of its integral function is ... [Content truncated for context window]

## **What is basic calculus?**

Calculus, a foundational branch of mathematics, serves as the bedrock for understanding change and motion in the world around us. Developed independently by luminaries like Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, calculus encompasses two main branches: [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus) and [integral calculus](https://guruathome.org/blog/what-is-integral-calculus-its-types-and-methods-to-evaluate-it/). The use of calculus have their origin from mathematics and stem to almost all the major fields of study.

[Book A Free Demo](https://guruathome.org/book-a-free-trial-class/)

#### Table of Contents

#### **Definition of Calculus:**

Calculus is a mathematical discipline dedicated to understanding change and motion. Its two core branches, differential calculus examining rates of change and integral calculus exploring accumulation, together provide a comprehensive framework. This intricate and robust framework is invaluable for tackling dynamic challenges across various disciplines.

#### **What is the basics of Calculus:**

Imagine calculus as the storyteller of continuous change in the world of mathematics. It’s like the GPS that guides us through the twists and turns of how quantities morph with respect to one another. Think of it as a duo, with two main characters: differential calculus, the maestro of instantaneous rate of change, and integral calculus, the detective investigating the accumulation of quantities.

Basic calculus isn’t just a set of rules to memorize; it’s the foundation that supports the understanding of more complex mathematical concepts. It’s the toolbox that contains both differential and integral calculus, honing in on those fundamental principles that open the door to advanced applications. At its heart, basic calculus equips learners with the tools to decipher change, a concept that ripples through fields as diverse as physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

You must know why your [kid should learn calculus](https://guruathome.org/blog/why-students-learn-calculus/).

#### **Chapters in basic Calculus:**

Now, as we dive into basic calculus, picture it as an adventure with a structured roadmap. The chapters unfold like stepping stones, guiding students from the basics to the practical applications. We’re talking about:

1. Differential Calculus:

- Introduction to Derivatives
- Rules of Differentiation
- Applications of Derivatives

After a [quick review](https://avidemia.com/review-of-precalculus/) of the skills we need to study calculus (Chapters 1–3), we will begin with the concept of a limit and continuity in Chapter 4. We will then continue to learn about the derivative of a function and how to find it in Chapter 5. Derivatives have many important applications that will be discussed in chapter 6. In chapter 7, we will learn how to find a function if its derivative is given. Chapter 8 will discuss how to find the area under a curve. This process is called integration. Finally, in the last chapter, we will talk about the applications of integration.
