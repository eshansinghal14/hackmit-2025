From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Branch of mathematics

**Linear algebra** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) such as

a1x1+⋯+anxn=b,{\\displaystyle a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n}=b,}

[linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) such as

(x1,…,xn)↦a1x1+⋯+anxn,{\\displaystyle (x\_{1},\\ldots ,x\_{n})\\mapsto a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n},}

and their representations in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3)

In three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), these three planes represent solutions to linear equations, and their intersection represents the set of common solutions: in this case, a unique point. The blue line is the common solution to two of these equations.

Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), including for defining basic objects such as [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)), [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)) and [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)). Also, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis), a branch of [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_functions).

Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For [nonlinear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with [first-order approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_approximation), using the fact that the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mathematics)) of a [multivariate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_function) at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.

## Your Mission as Agent 1:
1. Analyze ONLY the research sources assigned to you above
2. Extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from YOUR assigned sources
3. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology
4. Base nodes strictly on the content provided in your sources
5. Focus on the most important and well-supported concepts
6. Ensure nodes are specific and actionable
7. Include both foundational and advanced concepts if present

## Agent Coordination:
- You are Agent 1 of 5 total agents
- Each agent analyzes different sources to avoid duplication
- Your findings will be combined with other agents' results
- Focus on quality over quantity from your assigned sources

## Output Format:
Generate your knowledge nodes in this exact format:

**Agent 1 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. [Node Name]
2. [Node Name]
3. [Node Name]
4. [Node Name]
5. [Node Name]

**Source Summary:**
- Sources Analyzed: 2
- Agent Coverage: 2 of 8 total sources

Generate your specialized knowledge nodes now based strictly on your assigned research sources above.
