# What Is Linear Algebra?

Written by Coursera Staff • Updated on May 6, 2025

Learn what linear algebra is, its common concepts, and its use in machine learning, as well as careers you can pursue that use linear algebra.

Linear algebra combines multivariate calculus, differential equations, and probability into a widely applicable mathematical theory and system that undergirds many technologies in our lives. At its core, linear algebra studies vectors and linear functions to solve systems of linear equations that contain multiple variables. It focuses on calculating vectors, which are points in space with magnitude and direction, and matrices, which are tables of numbers.

While linear algebra is not a prerequisite for starting in machine learning, its concepts become foundational for a deeper understanding of the algorithms used in machine learning. It can help when you encounter deep learning concepts so that you can make informed decisions when developing a new machine learning system.

This article takes a deeper look at concepts in linear algebra, its uses, its users, how it's employed in machine learning, and how you can study it.

## Concepts in linear algebra

Linear algebra contains many applicable concepts. Here are some of the concepts in linear algebra that are also useful in machine learning:

- Vectors and vector spaces

- Systems of linear equations

- Matrices

- Eigenvalues and [Eigenvectors](https://www.coursera.org/articles/eigenvector-centrality)


Let’s take a closer look at each concept.

### What is linear algebra in simple terms?

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that analyzes vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. One of its main concerns is finding solutions using vectors to represent something in physical space. Solutions are called vector spaces, and you can add and multiply vectors to find these solutions.

### Vectors and vector spaces

A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. In linear algebra, you can add and multiply vectors by following the vector addition and multiplication rules. Linear algebra deals with many kinds of vectors:

- Power series

- Polynomials

- Numbers

- n-vectors

- Functions with a specific domain

- 2nd order polynomials


A vector space is a set that adds and multiplies the properties of a vector. Vector spaces have 10 axioms that vectors follow when adding and multiplying.

### Systems of linear equations

Linear algebra examines linear functions, which have vectors as both the input and the output. A matrix is an example of a linear function when it is multiplied by transforming a vector into another vector. A system of linear equations changes to a matrix equation through an augmented matrix in a process called Gaussian elimination. To solve a system of linear equations, you use reduced row echelon form, which simplifies the system of equations into a matrix, getting the linear equation into a solvable form.

Imagine you’re a builder, tasked with constructing a sturdy bridge across a river. You need to plot straight lines and calculate angles to ensure the bridge stands tall and strong.

This is where linear algebra steps in! It offers you a toolbox filled with matrices and vectors to map out your design in a mathematical space.

**Linear algebra is a type of math that solves straight-line problems. It uses grids of numbers called matrices to show these problems in vector space. Basically, it’s about how straight lines and vectors work in math.**

Linear algebra is really important in fields like engineering and physics. It helps us figure out various natural phenomena.

The main things we look at in linear algebra are straight-line problems, matrices, and spaces. Understanding these ideas is key to getting the basics of this subject.In this article, we will cover:

- Linear-Algebra topics
- Resources to learn Linear Algebra
- 3 types of Linear Algebra

## **Linear Algebra topics**

Linear algebra covers three main areas: linear equations, matrices, and vectors. The areas are interconnected and understanding them is crucial for mastering linear algebra. Let’s break down the topics within each category:

### **Linear Equations**

A linear equation is a foundational concept of linear algebra. It’s a mathematical expression written in a standard form, like a1x1 + a2x2 + … + anxn. In Linear equations, you work with variables.

##### The Subject of This Textbook

Before starting with the content of the text, we first ask the basic question: what _is_ linear algebra?

- _Linear:_ having to do with lines, planes, etc.
- _Algebra:_ solving equations involving unknowns.

The name of the textbook highlights an important theme: the synthesis between algebra and geometry. It will be very important to us to understand systems of linear equations both _algebraically_ (writing equations for their solutions) and _geometrically_ (drawing pictures and visualizing).

**Remark**

The term “algebra” was coined by the 9th century mathematician Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. It comes from the Arabic word _al-jebr_, meaning reunion of broken parts.

At the simplest level, solving a system of linear equations is not very hard. You probably learned in high school how to solve a system like

Ax+3y−z=42x−y+3z=17y−4z=−3.

However, in real life one usually has to be more clever.

- Engineers need to solve many, many equations in many, many variables. Here is a tiny example:
BEDEC3x1+4x2+10x3+19x4−2x5−3x6=1417x1+2x2−13x3−7x4+21x5+8x6=2567−x1+9x2+32x3+x4+14x5+27x6=2612x1+4x2+10x3+11x4+2x5+x6=−15.

- Often it is enough to know some information about the set of solutions, without having to solve the equations in the first place. For instance, does there exist a solution? What does the solution set look like geometrically? Is there still a solution if we change the 26 to a 27?
- Sometimes the coefficients also contain parameters, like the _eigenvalue equation_
A(7−λ)x+y+3z=0−3x+(2−λ)y−3z=0−3x−2y+(−1−λ)z=0.

- In data modeling, a system of equations generally does not actually have a solution. In that case, what is the best approximate solution?

Accordingly, this text is organized into three main sections.

1. Solve the matrix equation Ax=b (chapters 2–4).

 - Solve systems of linear equations using matrices, row reduction, and inverses.
 - Analyze systems of linear equations geometrically using the geometry of solution sets and linear transformations.
2. Solve the matrix equation Ax=λx (chapters 5–6).

 - Solve eigenvalue problems using the characteristic polynomial.
 - Understand the geometry of matrices using similarity, eigenvalues, diagonalization, and complex numbers.
3. Approximately solve the matrix equation Ax=b (chapter 7).

 - Find best-fit solutions to systems of linear equations that have no actual solution using least-squares approximations.
 - Study the geometry of closest vectors and orthogonal projections.

This text is roughly half computational and half conceptual in nature. The main goal is to present a library of linear algebra tools, and more importantly, to teach a conceptual framework for understanding which tools should be applied in a given context.

If Matlab can find the answer faster than you can, then your question is just an algorithm: this is not real problem solving.

Topics covered include linear systems, matrices, Gaussian elimination, vectors, vector spaces, vector-matrix multiplication, and transformations. These concepts are essential in fields such as machine learning, computer graphics, cryptography, and information theory.

* * *

## Introduction

**This article is part of a series called "** [**Log Base Two**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/log-base-two) **", a series dedicated to the relationship between math and computer science**.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've **excelled** in a total of 10 college courses in math:

01. Single-variable differential calculus

02. Single-variable integral calculus

03. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus

04. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions

05. Linear Algebra

06. Differential equations

07. Probability and statistics

08. Data analysis using R programming language

09. Multivariate statistics

10. Discrete math


For a large majority of those 10 classes, I ended up with A's.

Although, before college, I struggled a lot with math in the classroom, even though math had always been my favorite subject since I was in elementary school. I found it hard to truly grasp the concepts taught because my high school teachers were too focused on skill assessment. Instead of focusing on the actual concept being taught, I was too worried about how I was going to pass the test the following week.

Once I got to college, I realized that your math grade (or any grade for that matter) truly doesn't define your potential. Further, I'd argue that your success in math _education_ is heavily influenced by the quality of the teacher/professor's teaching.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest (in this case, computer science). Along the way, I hope to also supplement your math education with quality content. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and truly loving mathematics.

**New articles in this series are posted every Thursday. If you have any suggestions for a specific topic I should write about, please comment it down below!**

1 Basic Concepts and Notation
Linear algebra provides a way of compactly representing and operating on sets of linear
equations. For example, consider the following system of equations:
4x1 − 5x2 = −13
−2x1 + 3x2 = 9.
This is two equations and two variables, so as you know from high school algebra, you
can find a unique solution for x1 and x2 (unless the equations are somehow degenerate, for
example if the second equation is simply a multiple of the first, but in the case above there
is in fact a unique solution). In matrix notation, we can write the system more compactly
as
Ax = b
with
A =


Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of vectors, vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations. It deals with linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and determinants. It has a wide range of applications in Physics and Mathematics. It is the basic concept for machine learning and data science.

Some applications of Linear Algebra are:

**Linear Algebra Equations**

> The general linear equation is represented as **u** ****1**** **x** ****1**** **\+ u** ****2**** **x** ****2**** **\+ ..... u** ****n**** **x** ****n**** **= v**

Where,

- u’s – represents the coefficients
- x’s – represents the unknowns
- v – represents the constant

There is a collection of equations called a System of linear algebraic equations. It obeys the linear function such as -

> (x1,……..xn) → u1x1 \+ ………. \+ unxn
