# I have a few minutes for Calculus, what can I learn?

## 1 minute: The Big Aha!

> Level 1: Appreciation

Calculus is the art of splitting patterns apart (X-rays, derivatives) and gluing patterns together (Time-lapses, integrals). Sometimes we can cleverly re-arrange the pattern to find a new insight.

A circle can be split into rings:

And the rings turned into a triangle:

Wow! We found the circle's area in a simpler way. Welcome to Calculus.

# Fundamental Theorems of Calculus to Know for AP Calculus AB/BC

#### Related Subjects

[♾️ AP Calculus AB/BC](https://library.fiveable.me/ap-calc)

The Fundamental Theorems of Calculus connect differentiation and integration, showing how they work together. These concepts are vital for evaluating definite integrals, understanding areas under curves, and applying calculus in economics and management for real-world decision-making.

01. **First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**

 - Establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.
 - States that if ( f ) is continuous on (\[a, b\]) and ( F ) is an antiderivative of ( f ), then (\\int\_a^b f(x) , dx = F(b) - F(a)).
 - Provides a method to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives.
02. **Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**

 - States that if ( f ) is continuous on an interval, then the function ( F(x) = \\int\_a^x f(t) , dt ) is differentiable.
 - The derivative of ( F ) is equal to the original function: ( F'(x) = f(x) ).
 - Reinforces the concept that integration and differentiation are inverse processes.
03. **Relationship between differentiation and integration**

 - Differentiation measures the rate of change, while integration measures accumulation.
 - The two processes are interconnected; one can be used to undo the other.
 - Understanding this relationship is crucial for solving calculus problems effectively.
04. **Definite integrals as area under a curve**

 - A definite integral represents the net area between the curve of a function and the x-axis over a specified interval.
 - Positive areas above the x-axis and negative areas below it are accounted for in the integral.
 - This concept is fundamental in applications such as physics and economics.
05. **Evaluating definite integrals using antiderivatives**

 - To evaluate a definite integral, find an antiderivative of the function.
 - Apply the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: compute ( F(b) - F(a) ).
 - This method simplifies the process of finding areas and total accumulation.
06. **The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals**

 - States that if ( f ) is continuous on (\[a, b\]), there exists at least one ( c ) in ((a, b)) such that ( f(c) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int\_a^b f(x) , dx ).
 - Provides a way to find an average value of a function over an interval.
 - Useful in understanding the behavior of functions and their averages.
07. **Applications of the Fundamental Theorems in economics and management**

 - Used to calculate consumer and producer surplus through definite integrals.
 - Helps in modeling growth and decay in economic contexts.
 - Provides tools for analyzing cost, revenue, and profit functions.
08. **Using the Fundamental Theorems to solve optimization problems**

 - Theorems can be applied to find maximum and minimum values of functions.
 - Involves setting the derivative equal to zero and using the second derivative test.
 - Essential for making info... [Content truncated for context window]

Differential calculus is a branch of calculus that studies the concept of a derivative and its applications. Derivative tells us about the rate at which a function changes at any given point. Differential Calculus is crucial to many scientific and engineering areas since it allows for the estimation of instantaneous rates of change and curve slopes. In this article, we will be discussing about Differential Calculus and its fundamentals, which every students should know.

This article helps learners in understanding of differential calculus, its concepts, and its applications. By the end of this article, readers should be able to understand the fundamentals of derivatives and use them to solve real-world issues.

### Source 29: 6.4 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus – Techniques of Calculus 1

**Content:**
"

[Skip to content](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/psu.pb.unizin.org#content)

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the meaning of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
- State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1.
- Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, to evaluate derivatives of integrals.
- State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.
- Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, to evaluate definite integrals.
- Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration.

In the previous two sections, we looked at the definite integral and its relationship to the area under the curve of a function. Unfortunately, so far, the only tools we have available to calculate the value of a definite integral are geometric area formulas and limits of Riemann sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at some more powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.

These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This relationship was discovered and explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early 1700s, and it is codified in what we now call the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, which has two parts that we examine in this section. Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of calculus.

Isaac Newton’s contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the world. The relationships he discovered, codified as Newton’s laws and the law of universal gravitation, are still taught as foundational material in physics today, and his calculus has spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, [Britannica’s page](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-Newton) on Newton with multimedia clips.

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let’s examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

The **Mean Value Theorem for Integrals** states that a continuous function on a closed interval takes on its average value at the same point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] is continuous, a point \[latex\]c\[/latex\] exists in an interval \[latex\]\\left\[a,b\\right\]\[/latex\] such that the value of the function at \[latex\]c\[/latex\] is equal to the average value of \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] over \[latex\]\\left\[a,b\\right\].\[/latex\] We state this theorem mathematically with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.

### The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

If \[latex\]f(x)\[/latex\] is continuous over an interval \[latex\]\\left\[a,b\\right\],\[/latex\] then there is at least one point \[latex\]c\\in \\left\[a,b\\right\]\[/latex\] such that

We often get questions here from people self-studying mathematics. One of those questions is what mathematics should I study and in what order. So to answer those questions, I have decided to make a list of topics a mathematician should ideally know and what prerequisites the topics have.

## **Calculus**

After high school stuff comes calculus. This includes:

1. Differentiation
[Differentiation is finding the tangent line to a specific function](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/continuous-nowhere-differentiable-function-part-2/). You can deduce surprisingly many facts from this procedure.
_Prerequisites:_ Basic stuff
_Important topics:_ **a)** Continuity
**b)** Limits
**c)** Derivatives
**d)** Rules for differentiation
**e)** Mean value theorem and consequences
**f)** Geometrical meaning of derivatives
**g)** Curve sketching
**h)** Rate of change
2. Integration
Integration is the opposite process of differentiation. Integration is used to find areas, lengths, and so much more.
_Prerequisites:_ Differentiation
_Important topics:_ **a)** [Indefinite integrals](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/misconceptions-indefinite-integrals/) **b)** Rules of indefinite integration
**c)** Definite integration
**d)** Rules for definite integration
**e)** [Fundamental theorem of calculus](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/a-numerical-insight-for-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus/) **f)** Application of integration to find areas, volumes, and lengths
**g)** Applications to Physics
3. Sequences and series
Sequences and series are important for approximating certain functions. For example, the sine and the logarithm functions can be approximated very nicely with series.
_Prerequisites:_ Differentiation and integration
_Important topics:_ **a)** Convergence of sequences
**b)** Converges of series **c)** Special sequences and series
**d)** Convergence tests for series
**e)** Taylor series
**f)** [Integration and differentiation](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/an-overview-of-complex-differentiation-and-integration/) with series
4. Multivariable calculus
Everything in single variable calculus of course also works in multiple dimensions. _Prerequisites:_ single-variable calculus
_Important topics:_ **a)** Basic spatial geometry, like parametrization of lines and curves **b)** [Limits and continuity](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/epsilontic-limits-and-continuity/) in multivariable functions
**c)** Differentiation of multivariable functions
**d)** Integration of multivaria... [Content truncated for context window]
