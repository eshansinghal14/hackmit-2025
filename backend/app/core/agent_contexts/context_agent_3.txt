Linear algebra is a bedrock for all data science and machine learning tasks.

It is the language that transforms theoretical models into practical solutions.

It embodies principles that allow algorithms to learn from data.

1. **Representation of data**: a structured way to organize and manipulate data, allowing complex datasets to be represented as matrices
2. **dimensionality reduction**: techniques like PCA rely on linear algebra to reduce the number of variables to enhance model efficiency without losing important information
3. **optimization**: gradient descent, the core engine for ML, uses linear algebra to find the minimum of a function.

## 1.1 Introduction to MAT 67

This class may well be one of your first mathematics classes that bridges the gap between the mainly computation-oriented lower division classes and the abstract mathematics encountered in more advanced mathematics courses. The goal of this class is threefold:

1. You will learn **Linear Algebra**, which is one of the most widely used mathematical theories around. Linear Algebra finds applications in virtually every area of mathematics, including Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations, and Probability Theory. It is also widely applied in fields like physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, and engineering. You are even relying on methods from Linear Algebra every time you use an Internet search like Google, the Global Positioning System (GPS), or a cellphone.
2. You will acquire **computational skills** to solve linear systems of equations, perform operations on matrices, calculate eigenvalues, and find determinants of matrices.
3. In the setting of Linear Algebra, you will be introduced to **abstraction**. We will develop the theory of Linear Algebra together, and you will learn to write proofs.

The lectures will mainly develop the theory of Linear Algebra, and the discussion sessions will focus on the computational aspects. The lectures and the discussion sections go hand in hand, and it is important that you attend both. The exercises for each Chapter are divided into more computation-oriented exercises and exercises that focus on proof-writing. There are also some very short webwork homework sets to make sure you have some basic skills. You can already try the first one that introduces some logical concepts by clicking below: Webwork link.

## 1.2 What is Linear Algebra?

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics aimed at solving systems of linear equations with a ﬁnite number of unknowns. In particular, one would like to obtain answers to the following questions:

- **Characterization of solutions**: Are there solutions to a given system of linear equations? How many solutions are there?
- **Finding solutions:** How does the solution set look? What are the solutions?

Linear Algebra is a systematic theory regarding the solutions of systems of linear equations.

**Example 1.2.1.** Let us take the following system of two linear equations in the two unknowns \\(x\_1\\) and \\(x\_2\\) :

\\begin{equation\*} \\left. \\begin{array}{rl} 2x\_1 + x\_2 &= 0 \\\ x\_1 - x\_2 &= 1 \\end{array} \\right\\}. \\end{equation\*}

This system has a **unique solution** for \\(x\_1,x\_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), namely \\(x\_1=\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(x\_2=-\\frac{2}{3}\\). This solution can be found in several different ways. One approach is to ﬁrst solve for one of the unknowns in one of the equations and then to substitute the result into the other equation. Here, for example, we might solve to obtain

\\\[ x\_1 = 1 + x\_2 \\\]
