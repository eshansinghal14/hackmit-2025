### Source 4: Free Linear Algebra textbook, from Jim Hefferon

**Content:**
_Linear Algebra_
by Jim Hefferon
is a text for a first undergraduate course.
It is Free.
Use it as the main book, as a supplement, or for independent study.

### Get the book

Clicking on this link offers you a chance to contribute to
OpenIntro,
who work to make Open materials more adoptable.
You can get the electronic version of the
text for free by just setting the slider to 0:
[Download _Linear Algebra_](https://www.openintro.org/go?id=linalg4&referrer=hefferon.net).
(If you do contribute to
[OpenIntro.org](https://www.openintro.org)
then note that the page wording is confusing.
It says that the money
goes to the author but instead it means OpenIntro.)

### Text highlights

- Standard coverage
Linear systems and Gauss's method,
vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants,
and eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
- Developmental approach
The book proves all of the results
but does not start by assuming that
students are already able at abstract work.
Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
motivation, many computational examples,
and many exercises.
The goal is to raise
each student's level of
mathematical maturity.
- Extensive exercise sets
Each subsection has a wide range of exercises,
from
routine verifications to a few challenges.
The
[book of solutions](https://jheffero.w3.uvm.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf)
gives the answer to every one, completely worked.
And, clicking on a problem
takes you to its answer
while clicking on the answer takes you back to the problem.
- Popular
Used in hundreds of classes at many schools,
as well as by thousands of people
for independent study.
- Applications
Each chapter finishes with four or five short
supplemental topics
for reading or projects, or for
small group work.
- Extras
There are
[beamer slides](https://jheffero.w3.uvm.edu/linearalgebra/slides.zip)
for classroom presentations,
a
[lab manual](https://jheffero.w3.uvm.edu/linearalgebra/lab.pdf)
using
[_Sage_](https://www.sagemath.org/),
and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwF3A0R8OzMoMlE1-SaEh8h9VqUlO-r52).
For more, see the page for [instructors](https://hefferon.net/teaching.html).
- Prerequisite
One semester of calculus.
- Free
Everything is
[Freely available](https://hefferon.net/source.html),
including the
[LaTeX source](https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra).
You can also buy a
[paper copy of the book](https://hefferon.net/hardcopy.html).
- Reviews
Some from:
[the Mathematical Association of America](https://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/19/?pa=reviews&sa=viewBook&bookId=72055),
[the American Institute of Mathematics](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/24),

[_The Assayer_, a longstanding site about free texts](https://www.theassayer.org/cgi-bin/asbook.cgi?book=29).
- Award winning
Recipient of the 2020 Solow Award
from the Mathematical Association of America, for
“impact on undergraduate education in mathematics.”

## Your Mission as Agent 2:
1. Analyze ONLY the research sources assigned to you above
2. Extract 3-5 key knowledge nodes from YOUR assigned sources
3. Each node should be a distinct concept, technique, or methodology
4. Base nodes strictly on the content provided in your sources
5. Focus on the most important and well-supported concepts
6. Ensure nodes are specific and actionable
7. Include both foundational and advanced concepts if present

## Agent Coordination:
- You are Agent 2 of 5 total agents
- Each agent analyzes different sources to avoid duplication
- Your findings will be combined with other agents' results
- Focus on quality over quantity from your assigned sources

## Output Format:
Generate your knowledge nodes in this exact format:

**Agent 2 Knowledge Nodes for: Linear Algebra**

1. [Node Name]
2. [Node Name]
3. [Node Name]
4. [Node Name]
5. [Node Name]

**Source Summary:**
- Sources Analyzed: 2
- Agent Coverage: 2 of 8 total sources

Generate your specialized knowledge nodes now based strictly on your assigned research sources above.
