## Linear Algebra Definitions

Before we do anything interesting with machine learning or optimization, we’ll need to review some essential linear algebra concepts.

Suppose we have two vectors \\(u,v \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n \\times 1}\\). Their _outer product_ is defined as \\(u \\cdot v^T\\), which is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. The inner product of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is defined \\(u^Tv \\in \\mathbf{R}^{1 \\times 1}\\), a scalar.

Orthogonal vectors satisfy \\(v^Tu = 0\\). For all \\(x \\neq 0\\), if the quadratic form is positive \\(x^TAx > 0\\), then the matrix is symmetric positive matrix; if instead \\(x^TAx \\geq 0\\), the matrix is symmetric positive semi-definite.

A vector norm assigns a scalar value to vector or matrix. It turns out that all norms are _equivalent_, meaning we can bound a certain norm above and below

\\\[\\delta \\\|x\\\|\_0 \\leq \\\|x\\\|\_{\\square} \\leq \\gamma \\\|x\\\|\_0\\\]

e.g. \\(\\\|x\\\|\_{\\alpha} \\leq C\_{\\alpha \\beta} \\\| x \\\|\_{\\beta}\\), or \\(\\\|x\\\|\_2 \\leq \\\|x\\\|\_1 \\leq \\sqrt{n} \\\|x\\\|\_2\\).

Many matrix norms are _induced_ from vector norms.

### Matrix Rank

### Vector Space

### Null Space of a Matrix

Given \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\), the **null space** of \\(A\\) is the set of vectors which are sent to the zero vector:

\\\[\\mathcal{N}(A) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid Ax = 0 \\}\\\]

Multiplication by \\(A\\) can be seen as a function which sends a vector \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) to a vector \\(Ax \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\).

Of course, \\(\\mathcal{N}(A)\\) always contains the zero vector, i.e. \\({0} \\in \\mathcal{N}(A)\\). But the question is, does it contain any other vectors? If the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent, then we can always say \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) = {0} \\).

### Column Space (Range) of a Matrix

Given an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we would like to know for which vectors \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) the system \\(Ax = b\\) has a solution. Let’s define the columns of \\(A\\) as:

\\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix} \| & \| & & \| \\\ v\_1 & v\_2 & \\cdots & v\_n \\\ \| & \| & & \| \... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 13: 1: What is Linear Algebra?

**Content:**
[Skip to main content](https://math.libretexts.org/math.libretexts.org#elm-main-content)

Many difficult science problems can handled using the powerful, yet easy to use, mathematics of linear algebra. Unfortunately, because the subject (at least for those learning it) requires seemingly arcane and tedious computations involving large arrays of number known as matrices, the key concepts and the wide applicability of linear algebra are easily missed. Therefore, before we equip you with matrix skills, let us give some hints about what linear algebra is. The takeaway message is

> ﻿Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations.

﻿In broad terms, vectors are things you can add and linear transformations are very special functions of vectors that respect vector addition. To understand this a little better, lets try some examples. Please be prepared to change the way you think about some familiar mathematical objects and keep a pencil and piece of paper handy!

- [1.2: What Are Linear Functions?](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Linear_Algebra/Map%3A_Linear_Algebra_(Waldron_Cherney_and_Denton)/01%3A_What_is_Linear_Algebra/1.02%3A_What_Are_Linear_Functions)In calculus classes, the main subject of investigation was functions and their rates of change. In linear algebra, functions will again be focus of your attention, but now functions of a very special type.

One way to learn about them is by studying systems of linear equations.

Branch of mathematics

**Linear algebra** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) such as

a1x1+⋯+anxn=b,{\\displaystyle a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n}=b,}

[linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) such as

(x1,…,xn)↦a1x1+⋯+anxn,{\\displaystyle (x\_{1},\\ldots ,x\_{n})\\mapsto a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n},}

and their representations in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3)

In three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), these three planes represent solutions to linear equations, and their intersection represents the set of common solutions: in this case, a unique point. The blue line is the common solution to two of these equations.

Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), including for defining basic objects such as [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)), [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)) and [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)). Also, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis), a branch of [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_functions).

Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For [nonlinear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with [first-order approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_approximation), using the fact that the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mathematics)) of a [multivariate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_function) at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.

## Welcome to the Wonderful World of Linear Algebra!

In today’s age of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that holds the most relevance to computing.

Why learn Linear Algebra in computer science and data analytics? Its role is similar to that of the alphabet or vocabulary or grammar in learning a language. If we want to be a writer, for instance, we have to be good at all these aspects of the language of our choice. Having these background skills alone is not enough; it will not make us a writer. But what is absolutely certain is that _without_ these skills, we will _never_ be a writer, not a good one at any rate.Linear Algebra, in much the same way, is really the basic backdrop of several of the pivotal numerical algorithms in computer science and machine learning.

Linear Algebra Review and Reference
Zico Kolter
October 16, 2007
1 Basic Concepts and Notation
Linear algebra provides a way of compactly representing and operating on sets of linear
equations. For example, consider the following system of equations:
4x1 − 5x2 = −13
−2x1 + 3x2 = 9 .
This is two equations and two variables, so as you know from high school algebra, you
can find a unique solution for x1 and x2 (unless the equations are somehow degenerate, for
example if the second equation is simply a multiple of the first, but in the case above there
is in fact a unique solution). In matrix notation, we can write the system more compactly
as:
Ax = b
with A =

4 −5
−2 3 
, b =

13
−9

.
As we will see shortly, there are many advantages (including the obvious space savings)
to analyzing linear equations in this form.
1.1 Basic Notation
We use the following notation:
• By A ∈ R
m×n we denote a matrix with m rows and n columns, where the entries of A
are real numbers.
• By x ∈ R
n
, we denote a vector with n entries. Usually a vector x will denote a column
vector — i.e., a matrix with n rows and 1 column. If we want to explicitly represent
a row vector — a matrix with 1 row and n columns — we typically write x
T
(here
x
T denotes the transpose of x, which we will define shortly).

• The ith element of a vector x is denoted xi

x =





x1
x2
.
.
.
xn





.
• We use the notation aij (or Aij , Ai,j , etc) to denote the entry of A in the ith row and
jth column:
A =



a11 a12 · · · a1n
a21 a22 · · · a2n

.
• We denote the jth column of A by aj or A:,j :
A =


| | |
a1 a2 · · · an
| | |

.
• We denote the ith row of A by a
T
i
or Ai,::
A =


.
• Note that these definitions are ambiguous (for example, the a1 and a
T
1
in the previous
two definitions are not the same vector). Usually the meaning of the notation should
be obvious from its use.
2 Matrix Multiplication
The product of two matrices A ∈ R
m×n and B ∈ Rn×p
is the matrix
C = AB ∈ R
m×p
,
where
Cij =
Xn
k=1
AikBkj .
Note that in order for the matrix product to exist, the number of columns in A must equal
the number of rows in B. There are many ways of looking at matrix multiplication, and
we’ll start by examining a few special cases.

2.1 Vector-Vector Products
Given two vectors x, y ∈ R
n
, the quantity x
T
y, sometimes called the inner product or dot
product of the vectors, is a real number given by
x
T
y ∈ R =
Xn
i=1
xiyi.
Note that it is always the case that x
T
y = y
T x.
Given vectors x ∈ R
m, y ∈ Rn
(they no longer have to be the same size), xyTis called
the outer product of the vectors. It is a matrix whose entries are given by (xyT)ij = xiyj,
i.e.,
xyT ∈ R
m×n =
