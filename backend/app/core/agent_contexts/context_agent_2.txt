# Mastering the basics of single variable calculus - A beginner's guide

In this course, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of single variable calculus, including key concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals.

Table of contents

## What is included in a calculus course?

The following 23 topics are typically included in a calculus course

1\. Limits

Functions are not always defined for all inputs. For instance, division by zero is not allowed. To see how the function look close to such an input, we study the limit as the input goes toward this point.

2\. Continuity

Integers are considered discrete numbers; they are distributed with gaps in-between them. The set of real numbers, however, is continuous, since between any two reals you will always find more of them. The same concept extend to functions, where a continuous function is one with no gaps.

3\. Derivatives

The derivative of a function gives its instantaneous rate of change at any point. This is analogous to the slope of a line parallel to the function there, which, together with the concept of limits, formulate the definition of the derivative:
$$f'(x) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

4\. Differentiation rules

Finding derivatives is not always straight-forward using the definition. Luckily, the subject is well-researched, and multiple handy rules have been discovered, simplifying the task depending on the form of the function.

5\. Mean value theorem

The mean value theorem is simple, yet powerful: Between any two points on a continuous function, the derivative will somewhere equal the slope of the line connecting the points.

* * *

6\. Implicit derivatives

If y is not a function of x, but we still have a relation between the two through some equation, we can not formulate the derivative as a function of x. This is the case for a circle with radius $a$:
$$x^2 + y^2 = a^2$$
A line tangent to this circle will have the slope $ -\\frac{y}{x}$. This derivative is implicit, as opposed to explicit as a function of $x$ alone.

7\. Inverse functions

A function is a way of processing numbers. You plug in some number and get out a new one. The inverse of a function is then a redo-process, which takes in the old output, and spits out the initial input.

8\. Antiderivatives

As hinted by the name, antiderivatives are the reverses of derivatives. If a function $f(x)$ has the derivative $f'(x)$, $... [Content truncated for context window]

### Source 12: A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus

**Content:**
I have a love/hate relationship with calculus: it demonstrates the beauty of math and the agony of math education.

Calculus relates topics in an elegant, brain-bending manner. My closest analogy is Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: once understood, you start seeing Nature in terms of survival. You understand why drugs lead to resistant germs (survival of the fittest). You know why sugar and fat taste sweet (encourage consumption of high-calorie foods in times of scarcity). It all fits together.

Calculus is similarly enlightening. Don’t these formulas seem related in some way?

They are. But most of us learn these formulas independently. Calculus lets us start with $\\text{circumference} = 2 \\pi r$ and figure out the others — the Greeks would have appreciated this.

**Unfortunately, calculus can epitomize what’s wrong with math education**. Most lessons feature contrived examples, arcane proofs, and memorization that body slam our intuition & enthusiasm.

It really shouldn’t be this way.

## Math, art, and ideas

I’ve learned something from school: **Math isn’t the hard part of math; motivation is.** Specifically, staying encouraged despite

- Teachers focused more on publishing/perishing than teaching
- Self-fulfilling prophecies that math is difficult, boring, unpopular or “not your subject”
- Textbooks and curriculums more concerned with [profits](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216021713/http://www.redshift.com/~jmichael/html/feynman.html) and test results than insight

[‘A Mathematician’s Lament’ \[pdf\]](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) is an excellent essay on this issue that [resonated](http://reddit.com/info/6baz9/comments/) [with](http://www.metafilter.com/70699/A-Mathematicians-Lament) [many people](http://www.math.princeton.edu/~bbukh/natural.html):

> “…if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child’s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn’t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done — I simply wouldn’t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soul-crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education.”

Imagine teaching art like this: **Kids, no fingerpainting in kindergarten.** Instead, let’s study paint chemistry, the physics of light, and the anatomy of the eye. After 12 years of this, if the kids (now teenagers) don’t hate art already, they may begin to start coloring on their own. After all, they have the “rigorous, testable” fundamentals to start appreciating art. Right?

Poetry is similar. Imagine studying this quote (formula):

```
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

— William Shakespeare, Hamlet

```

It’s an elegant way of saying “be yourself” (and if that means writing irreverently about math, so be it). But if this were math class, we’d be counting the syllables, analyzing the iambic pentameter, and mapping out the s... [Content truncated for context window]

## How to Understand Calculus

Calculus is a study of rates of change of functions and accumulation of infinitesimally small quantities. It can be broadly divided into two branches:

- **Differential Calculus.** This concerns rates of changes of quantities and slopes of curves or surfaces in 2D or multidimensional space.
- **Integral Calculus.** This involves summing infinitesimally small quantities.

© Eugene Brennan

## Who Invented Calculus?

Calculus was invented by the English mathematician, physicist and astronomer [Isaac Newton](https://discover.hubpages.com/education/Sir-Isaac-Newton-A-Great-Mind-that-Changed-the-World) and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently of each other in the 17th century.

Isaac Newton (1642 - 1726) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (below) invented calculus independent of each other in the 17th century.

## What Is Calculus Used For?

Calculus is used widely in mathematics, science, in the various fields of engineering and economics.

## Introduction to Limits of Functions

To understand calculus, we first need to grasp the concept of _limits_ of a function.

Imagine we have a continuous line function with the equation f(x) = x + 1 as in the graph below.

The value of f(x) is simply the value of the x coordinate plus 1.

f(x) = x + 1

© Eugene Brennan

The function is continuous which means that f(x) has a value that corresponds to all values of x, not just the integers ....-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...... [Content truncated for context window]

## **Introduction**

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus brings together two essential concepts in calculus: differentiation and integration. There are two parts to the Fundamental Theorem: the first justifies the procedure for evaluating definite integrals, and the second establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration. Here, we will focus on the first statement, which is referred to as the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

This theorem establishes the procedure for computing a definite integral. Recall that a definite integral is an integral where you are given the limits of integration. That is, you are integrating over an interval whose endpoints you use to evaluate the integral.

## **Indefinite vs. Definite Integrals**

An indefinite integral is an integral without limits of integration; for example,

\\int { { x }^{ 2 } } dx

When integrating this function, we are looking for a curve whose derivative is {x}^{2}. There are infinitely many curves with that derivative, including

\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }

\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }+1

\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }+8

\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }-3

\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }-\\sqrt { 5 }

While there are infinitely many options, we note that they differ only by a constant. As a result, when we integrate a function of this type, we add an arbitrary constant, C, to our solution, as follows:

\\int { { x }^{ 2 } } =\\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } { x }^{ 3 }+C

In contrast, a definite integral is one in which there are limits of integration. As an example, consider \\int \_{ 1 }^{ 4 }{ { x }^{ 2 } dx } . Here, we are being asked to integrate the same function as before, but we are doing so over the interval 1\\le x\\le 4. To compute this integral, we rely on the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## **The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**

The theorem states that if a function f(x) has an indefinite integral of F(x)+C and is continuous over an interval \[a,b\], then \\int \_{ a }^{ b }{ f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a) }.

Let’s go back to our prior example:

\\int \_{ 1 }^{ 4 }{ { x }^{ 2 ... [Content truncated for context window]

# Basics of Calculus for GATE Exam

Last Updated: 25th October, 2023

Calculus is a profound branch of mathematics that serves as a powerful tool for understanding and quantifying change and motion. Its development can be attributed to the brilliant minds of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century. This mathematical framework has since played a pivotal role in both mathematics and science, underpinning a wide range of disciplines such as physics, engineering, economics, and even biology. Let's delve into what calculus is and why it holds such paramount importance.

## **Calculus and the Essence of Change**

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It provides us with a systematic and rigorous approach to analyze and describe the processes of transformation and variation in the world around us. Whether it's tracking the position of a moving car, understanding how a population grows over time, or determining the rate at which a chemical reaction occurs, calculus equips us with the necessary mathematical machinery to make sense of these dynamic phenomena.

At its core, calculus deals with two fundamental concepts: differentiation and integration.

1. **Differentiation:** This facet of calculus is concerned with understanding the rate at which something changes. It involves finding derivatives, which are mathematical expressions representing the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point. In simpler terms, differentiation helps us understand how quantities such as velocity, acceleration, or growth rate change over time or with respect to other variables.
2. **Integration:** Integration, on the other hand, is the counterpart of differentiation. It helps us accumulate or find the total of quantities that change continuously. By calculating integrals, we can determine quantities like the total distance traveled, the accumulated area under a curve, or the net change in a quantity over a given interval.

Calculus, the mathematical study of continuous change, splits into two main branches: differential calculus, concerning rates of change and slopes of curves; and integral calculus, which deals with accumulation of quantities and areas under or between curves.

AP Calculus AB, one of the Advanced Placement courses for high school students, covers fundamental concepts of calculus. It includes limits, derivatives, integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Approximately equivalent to a first-semester college calculus course, it focuses mainly on differential and integral calculus with applications, providing a solid foundation in these core areas.

The AP Calculus AB test also emphasizes understanding conceptual frameworks, solving real-world problems, and using graphical, numerical, and analytical representations to solve challenges. It thoroughly prepares students for further studies in mathematics, science, and engineering.
